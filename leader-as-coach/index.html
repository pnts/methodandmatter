    <h2>Why This Course?</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">

    <p>Coaching is a comprehensive approach to leadership that transforms working relationships through learning conversations that impact individuals, teams, and business outcomes. In learning the foundations of coaching, leaders become better at delegating, creating shared agreements, providing feedback, and leading with clarity resulting in more impact (and happier teams) with less effort.</p>


    <p>Coaching in organizations is different than professional coaching - managers and leaders must know when to coach and how to keep learning inline with business needs. There is also a magnitude of difference between learning coaching frameworks through books (which are great!) and getting the hands-on experience practicing coaching in a safe container.</p>

    <h2>What People Are Saying</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <blockquote>
      <p>
      This thoughtful, well-designed course fills a critical gap in existing Leadership training and curricula: a cohort-based, short-term immersive program for leaders that effectively coexists alongside the busy schedules and competing priorities that often get in the way of leaders’ ability to focus on their professional growth & development. The agenda has a great flow, with dedicated time for active participation and practice of the frameworks introduced – both as a full cohort and in breakout groups. And the Leader’s Little Book of Coaching is a valuable companion for ongoing support of Leaders and their commitment to integrating coaching skills into their leadership repertoire.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Andi does such an amazing job at slowing you down and reframing the way you approach problems in a positive, conscious way. The course materials are invaluable, and the experiential learning was the best out of any course or leadership education I've been through. I felt really close to my cohort by the end, and have already started implementing pieces of the training with my direct reports. Looking forward to seeing how this framework can help me empower my team!</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I recently joined a Leader as Coach cohort and learned what it means to coach. Andi is a fantastic instructor who gave us powerful tools, exercises, and examples. Going into this training, I knew very little about coaching aside from it's different from mentoring. After completing the course, I walked away with a much deeper understanding of coaching and techniques I can immediately use. I highly recommend working with Andi to incorporate coaching into your skillset and improve your communication with others.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I can’t say enough good things about Andi and her way of coaching in this course 💜 What I found especially helpful:

        ✨ All the small, simple tools and tips you learn to bring about the best in yourself and your colleagues/team, superrich learning material
        ✨ Learning with and from other designers with similar challenges in their (team lead) work
        ✨ Very good balance between time investment (short) and what you learn (lots)
        ✨ Andrea’s presence can’t be beat
        ✨ Andrea’s interest in ontological design and decolonizing design shine through in her way of coaching
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        I really enjoyed the course and I would definitely recommend it to anyone that want to become a better leader, coach, manager and combine those 3 things more effectively. Even if some of the lessons happened after a long day at work, I always finished the videocall feeling renewed, energised, ready to try new things with my team the next day.

    <h2>Leader as Coach: 12 Skills</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p></p>
    <ol class="skills">
      <li>
        <h3>The Power of Presence</h3>
        <p>Your most powerful coaching tool isn’t a framework or methodology, it is <em>you</em>. How you show up matters.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Always Be Curious</h3>
        <p>We never know it all. Staying curious is the practice of uncovering more of the picture so that new actions can be taken, and new results achieved.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>It's All About Learning</h3>
        <p>Coaching conversations are about learning from experience - about how we impact the world, and how the world impacts us.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Listen Beyond the Words</h3>
        <p>Words point to the content of a situation. Tone, gesture, body posture, energy, pace, and other non-verbal cues hold important information about the context. Listen for both.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Know Where You Are</h3>
        <p>The state of your nervous system impacts how you see the world and how you coach others. Are you open to learning, or are you committed to being right?</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Build Partnership</h3>
        <p>Coaching is a relationship built on true partnership, where power and responsibility are shared. The coach trusts in the capacity people have to find their own solutions.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Begin Well</h3>
        <p>Beginnings set the stage for the conversation that follows. Knowing how to tend to and structure a beginning sets everyone up for success.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Explore Together</h3>
        <p>Coaching is about raising awareness around an opportunity or challenge so that new possibilities emerge. Open and honest questions guide the exploration.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Create Possibilities</h3>
        <p>Utilize reframing, distinctions, metaphors, and even resistance (!) to uncover new ways of seeing and new possibilities for action.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Conclude with Clarity</h3>
        <p>With increased awareness and possibilities, what new actions can be taken? What experiments can be run? What timeline feels supportive? Complete the conversation and allow the work to conclude.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Mind the Path</h3>
        <p>Coaching conversations are filled with “oh sh*t” moments. Learn some of the common obstacles to coaching and how to handle them, so you know what to do when things go off track.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Accountability <span class="amp">&</span> Progress</h3>
        <p>Coaching empowers people to take action to achieve the results they want. Accountability often increases with coaching conversations, especially when coaching is consistent over time.</p>
      </li>
