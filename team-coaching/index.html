  <h1>Healthy Systems for Healthy Teams <p>Whether your team is stuck or just wanting to flow better together, team coaching gets to the soul of the team to understand and articulate identities, practices, and cultures to help us do our best work, both as a team and as an organization.</p></h1>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>Built on the principles and foundations of individual coaching, team coaching takes a step back and integrates a holistic, systems approach to helping teams work better together. Team coaching includes:</p>
    <p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><p>In-depth interviews with the team and relevant stakeholders to understand the challenges and opportunities in front of the team, team identity, culture, and norms. </p></li>
        <li><p>A customized program designed for team-specific issues and outcomes </p></li>
        <li><p>Bi-weekly team coachign sessions</p></li>
        <li><p>Tailored practices to support new ways for the team to lead and work</p></li>
        <li><p>Resources for continued learning and development</p></li>
        <li><p>Follow-up notes, program updates, and action items from each session</p></li>
        <li><p>Email and text support in between sessions</p></li>

    <h2>Principles</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <h3 class="principles">1. Transformation takes place at biological time</h3>
    <p>There's no way around it - deep, lasting change takes time. This is true for individuals, for teams, and for organizations.  </p>

    <h3>2. Lead with humble inquiry</h3>
    <p>The simple act of asking questions releases us from the pressure of needing to have all the answers. The work of coaching, of reflection, of designing, is built upon the questions that we ask.</p>

    <h3>3. Strengths are the doorways to possibility</h3>
    <p>Our culture tends to focus on weaknesses and tries to fix them. When we shift to strengths we open the door to possibilities and make an orthogonal leap to an entirely different problem space rife with potential.</p>

    <h3>4. Serious play moves mountains</h3>
    <p>When we play games we adopt what <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grasshopper-Games-Life-Utopia/dp/155111772X/">Bernard Suits</a> calls the lusory attitude - we accept the arbitrary rules of a game to facilitate the experience of play. Work life is nothing if not a series of arbitrary rules; the lusory attitiude allows us to step outside the system and create space for creativity and innovation.  </p>

    <h3>5. Unique leadership breaks archetypes </h3>
    <p>In the tech world we're surrounded by a very specific archetype of what leadership looks like. But there are other ways to lead, ways that are authentic to who we are as individuals and when we embody that truth we become the leaders we are meant to be.</p>

    <h3>6. Use work to do <em>the work</em> </h3>
    <p>Poet <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Heart-Aroused-Preservation-Corporate-America-ebook/dp/B000XUBFF6/">David Whyte</a> talks about <em>the chasm</em> - the split between what is nourishing at work and what is agonizing. When we learn to accept the chasm we connect more deeply with ourselves and through this connection transform our experience of work.</p>
