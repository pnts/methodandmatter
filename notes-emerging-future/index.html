    <h1>Notes from the Emerging Future</h1>
    <p>An exercise for connecting to what you most long for, finding your unique path, and becoming the person who is capable of calling that future forward.</p>

    <h2>The Background</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>This exercise isn't really about setting a specific goal or vision of the future and then figuring out how to make it a reality. What we consciously strive for can be at odds with our soul's deepest desire. So how do we listen to the future that is calling? If you are feeling stuck or misaligned, like something is off or missing, this exercise can help you find the unique path that is meant for you, and you alone.</p>

    <h2>The Setting</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>Find a place where you feel nourished and grounded, alert and supported. This could be somewhere in your home, your office, a park, a library, a coffeeshop, or third space. Make sure this is a place where you can have a stretch of uninterrupted time to engage in deep imagination. Have a few of your favorite tools to capture thoughts and images: pen and paper, recording device, sketch pad, camera, phone are all great (just make sure notifications are off if you use your phone or computer).</p>

    <h2>Settling In</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">

    <p>Take a few deep breaths and feel your body settling into the chair, floor, or whatever is supporting you. Allow your thoughts to settle as you let your breath inhale and exhale be the same length. </p>
  </div>

    <h2>Imagining</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">

    <p>Think about a time in the future, whatever time frame feels right for you - next week, next year, 3 years, 5 years, 20 years - and connect with the 'you' of the future. Imagine that everything has worked out, and that any challenges you are currently facing have all be resolved. In this future you are living your fullest and most fulfilling life.<p>

    <p>From this place, describe what a day looks like in this future, from the time you wake up to the time you go bed. Describe in as much detail the places, people, relationships, activities, moods, routines, and interactions that fill your day. GET SPECIFIC. Imagine you are sharing this with your best friend or a trusted colleague. I like to use the Voice Memos app on the iPhone for this. I have heard <a href="https://otter.ai">Otter</a> is great as well (especially since it transcribes).</p>

    <p>Pay attention to what feels uncomfortable, scary, or exciting to say. Often times clients will say things out loud they've never said before. If it feels uncertain or wobbly the first time you say it, pause. Take a few deep breaths, feel your feet on the ground, and say it again with more power and clarity.</p>

    <p>Tip: Use the present tense when going through this exercise. Avoid using qualifiers which include words like might, possibly, and maybe. Make the day as concrete and alive as you can.</p>

    <h2>Capture It</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>Now, capture what came forward in a story, poem, mood board, essay, song, collage, or any other creative medium. The intention here is to create an artifact...</p>

    <h2>Reflection Questions</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>What parts of my Emerging Future have special resonance? What words, images, situations, excited or scared me? These are important seeds, clues to pay special attention to in the days and weeks ahead.</p>

    <p>Are there elements of my Emerging Future that do not have resonance? These might be things I know I am good at but just not excited about. They feel safe, or like things I <em>should</em> include.</p>

    <p>What parts of my Emerging Future am I already living?</p>

    <p>What can I begin doing tomorrow to live into this resonant future?</p>

    <p>What current limiting beliefs do I need to let go of to make room for the future you long for?</p>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>Continue to refine the map of your Emerging Future, deepening what feels resonant and culling anything that doesn't feel fully alive.</p>

    <p>Create a learning plan: what can you do in the next week, month, and year to set the foundations for the future you are living into?</p>
