  <h2>Pilot Coaching Program</h2>

  <h3>The Basics</h3>
  <p>Hello! If you are reading this you've probably received an email from either myself or one of my lovely colleagues. My name is <a href="https://pnts.us/bio">Andrea Mignolo</a> and I am a design executive, leadership coach, and organizational design consultant. While <a href="https://pnts.us/coaching">coaching</a> has been part of my practice for a while, I took the step in 2018 to become certified as an Integral Coach through <a href="https://newventureswest.com">New Ventures West</a>. As part of my certification in September of 2019 I am looking for an initial cohort of <strong>five clients</strong> to join the pilot program. Method & Matter is the company under which this program, and subsequent coaching programs, will run.</p>

  <h3>The Program</h3>
  <p>The program is open for anyone who is interested in coaching. If you are in a new leadership role, facing frustrating challenges, feeling stuck, or bumping up against obstacles, coaching can help.</p>

  <p>The program includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>10 individual coaching sessions (1hr each)</li>
      <li>A personalized coaching program designed specifically for your  context and goals</li>
      <li>Tailored practices to support new ways of working and being</li>
      <li>Resources for continued learning and development</li>
      <li>Recordings of each session and follow-up notes</li>
      <li>Email and text support in between sessions (I'm here for you!)</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>About Integral Coaching</h3>
  <blockquote><em>"We call our work integral because we include everything about the client and the client’s world in our coaching. This includes what the client is aware of along with her potential—what could be brought about through focused, skillful methods. Our coaches bring forth a view of the client that includes how the client represents herself and also investigates her social world, habits, relationship with her body, the quality of self-care, the amount of attention and energy available to take on change, and much more."</em></blockquote>

  <p>The aim of Integral Coaching is to use <em>your</em> entire world as material for developing self-generating, self-sustaining practices that will be relevant through the arc of your career and life. Integral Coaching is not coaching for compliance, or coaching for accountability. It is deeply humanistic work that opens up insights and possibilities for a path forward.</p>

  <p>I've experienced the power of Integral Coaching personally. As part of my training I started working with an Integral Coach in September of 2018 and the work has been transformational. If it would help you decide if this program is right for you I'd be happy to share my experience. Just fill out the form below :).</p>

  <h3>What is the Difference Between Coaching and Therapy?</h3>
  <p>The International Coaching Federation (ICF) defines coaching in the following way: "Partnering with clients in a thought provoking and creative process that inspires them to maximize their personal and professional potential." Coaching focuses on what is happening in the present to help clients build capacity to grow in all areas of their life.</p>

  <p>Therapy generally looks back at past experiences and traumas to understand current behaviors. Depending on the type of professional therapy one seeks, different approaches and methodologies are used in healing and letting go of the past in order to cultivate a more stable and positive future.</p>

  <p>If you want to go deeper on this topic try the paper <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/cpb-1061-4087-53-4-229.pdf">Coaching Versus Therapy: A Perspective</a> from the American Psychological Association.

  <h3>What You Can Expect From Me</h3>
  <p>I am deeply committed to this work. You can expect a partner and ally, someone is who open to everything that you are and can be. Throughout our work together I will be your biggest champion and staunchest supporter. I will never tell you what to do or what you did wrong or coach for compliance. We will work together throughout the program to co-create new ways of working, living, and being. I adhere to and uphold the <a href="https://coachfederation.org/code-of-ethics">ICF Code of Ethics</a>; I will act professionally and responsibly in our interactions and will hold any information shared in strict confidentiality.</p>

  <h3>What I Expect From You</h3>
  <p>I am looking for clients who are open to the work of coaching and who can commit to 10 sessions over the course of 6 months. Ideally you are in New York City so we can meet in person for at least the first few sessions, but if not we can work something out via video chat. The personally tailored coaching programs generally include weekly practices and exercises that you'll be expected to <em>try</em> and commit to. I'm happy to work with crazy schedules but if the idea of adding even one more thing to your week is a no-go, this probably isn't for you.</p>

  <h3>Price</h3>
  <p>The pilot program is <strong>$750 USD</strong> for the entire package listed above, payable in one or two installments. How did I arrive at $750? My aim was to find a price point that respects our time, your commitment to the program, the value I bring to clients, and my background as a designer and executive. </p>

  <p>I have been actively training as an Integral Coach for six months and bring everything I have learned from the program to our work together. I also pull from my MBA training in Intentional Change Theory, Appreciative Inquiry, and organizational design, and from my years in leadership and management roles. The pilot program package is heavily discounted because I am not yet certified - these sessions are important part of that process. It's a great chance to try out coaching and see where it can take you.</p>
