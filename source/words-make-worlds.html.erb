    <h2>The Coaching Leadership Style (CLS) is an orientation to leadership that is built on a solid foundation of coaching skills including optimism, self-efficacy, positive emotions, and learning. Leaders who adopt the CLS exponentially increase their ability to  support others to develop their potential and take action that creates results.</h2>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“A coach is someone who helps another person reach higher effectiveness by creating a dialogue that leads to awareness and action.” &ndash; Anne Loehr & Brian Emerson</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>People who coach are driven by curiosity - about themselves, about others, and about the challenge or opportunity in front of them. It would not be wrong to say that coaching conversations are essentially learning conversations. When coaching skills are successfully integrated into a leadership practice, curiosity and learning become the default way of building relationships, making decisions, increasing awareness, and taking action.</p>

    <p>Curiosity and learning are also critical skills for uncertain times. With the increased complexity and pace of modern life we must always be updating our ideas and assumptions about how the world works. CLS provides leaders with tools to develop themselves and others to be responsive, reflective, and choiceful in how they think and the actions they take.  </p>

    <p>When a leader utilizes the CLS, they invoke a creative partnership with another person for the sake of learning and growth. The leader believes in the innate capacity of others to find creative solutions to the challenges they face and acts as a guide or facilitator of their learning process. Paradoxically, when a leader becomes proficient with the CLS, they achieve more by doing less. The CLS brings increased capacity for building strong relationships, having direct conversations, dealing with uncertainty, delegating, and accountability. </p>

    <p>Words Make Worlds is a bi-weekly newsletter dedicated to the art, science, and craft of the Coaching Leadership Style. Each issue focuses on one specific aspect of coaching &mdash; a methodology, tool, mindset, process, or approach &mdash; breaking it down into two areas of exploration. "The Idea" covers the conceptual side of things, while "The Practice" provides practical applications leaders can use experiment with The Idea at work.</p>
