> Man therefore creates a differentiation that is valid for the Whole, and he alone traces out an open direction that is able to express a whole that is itself open… whereas a distinct “plane” of nature corresponds to each one, man is capable of scrambling the planes, of going beyond his plane as his own condition, in order to finally express nature Naturing.

&mdash; Deluze, Gilles. Bergsonism (p. 106 - 107).

> Since we each see only a part of reality, learning to see more requires that we take in other points of view and learn to work with them. No matter how minutely we examine positions, parts, pieces, data, individual aspects, we will not understand the whole and what meaning it holds. Listening to divergent positions helps to broaden perspectives and understand a greater picture.

&mdash; Hwochinsky, Carol. Listening with the Heart: A Guide for Compassionate Listening (p. 6). The Compassionate Listening Project - Digital Edition.

> A human being is part of the whole called by us a ‘universe,’ a part limited in time and space. We experience ourselves, our thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest — a kind of optical delusion of consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.

&mdash; Einstein, Albert  

> Because of the evolutionary development of the human brain and nervous system, we are no longer bound by this conditioned response. We now have the freedom to hold a greater vision: that of participant and that of observer. What this means is that not only can we think, we can be aware we are thinking. We are able to delay action when we are threatened or alarmed. We have the ability to observe ourselves more objectively and we can monitor our actions in the present moment.

&mdash; Hwochinsky, Carol. Listening with the Heart: A Guide for Compassionate Listening (p. xv).The Compassionate Listening Project - Digital Edition.

> Because we are part of the problem we are also part of the solution. These challenges require a new interaction. Since each human being has a piece of the answer to our problems, we must listen to each other in new ways for solutions to make themselves known. We are required to practice new ways of interaction for our very survival.

&mdash; Hwochinsky, Carol. Listening with the Heart: A Guide for Compassionate Listening (p. xiv).The Compassionate Listening Project - Digital Edition.

> ... we call this consensual braiding of languaging and emotioning conversation, and we think that what began, when humanness began in the transgenerational conservation of the braiding of languaging and emotioning, was a living in conversations as the manner of living that defined our lineage. As a consequence, all that we human beings do as human beings, takes place in networks of conversation. Human existence takes place in the flow of conversations in the braiding of recursive consensual coordinations of doings and domains of relational behaviors, and that what takes place through us outside conversations, is not human action.

> Once living in language had begun to be conserved in our Homo sapiens-amans lineage, it became possible for other languaging lineages in which love progressively diminished its presence as a basic emotion to branch off from it. We think that initially those lineages did not and could not persist for long precisely because as love as the grounding emotion of daily living diminished in them, the group was unable to survive ecological disasters. The members of those lineages could not form stable communities with the kind of inner emotional coherence that could lead to the expansion and conservation of the intuition and understanding that result in the necessary cooperation to overcome such disasters.
