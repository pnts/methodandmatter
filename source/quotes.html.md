> ... we call this consensual braiding of languaging and emotioning conversation, and we think that what began, when humanness began in the transgenerational conservation of the braiding of languaging and emotioning, was a living in conversations as the manner of living that defined our lineage. As a consequence, all that we human beings do as human beings, takes place in networks of conversation. Human existence takes place in the flow of conversations in the braiding of recursive consensual coordinations of doings and domains of relational behaviors, and that what takes place through us outside conversations, is not human action.

> Once living in language had begun to be conserved in our Homo sapiens-amans lineage, it became possible for other languaging lineages in which love progressively diminished its presence as a basic emotion to branch off from it. We think that initially those lineages did not and could not persist for long precisely because as love as the grounding emotion of daily living diminished in them, the group was unable to survive ecological disasters. The members of those lineages could not form stable communities with the kind of inner emotional coherence that could lead to the expansion and conservation of the intuition and understanding that result in the necessary cooperation to overcome such disasters.
