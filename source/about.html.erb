    <h2>Hi, I'm Andrea.</h2>

    <p>I founded method & matter because I believe in leaders like you. Leaders that don't necessarily "look" like the dominant leadership archetype. The early years of my leadership journey were fraught with doubt, derision, and failures as I struggled to find a way of leading that was aligned with my values and vision. With the guidance of an executive coach, I began unwinding beliefs that no longer served me while cultivating a connection with my power, purpose, and unique way of leading.

    <p>The work was nothing less than transformational -  and I want this for you, too.  </p>

    <p>Before becoming a coach I lead product and design teams for startups in the B2B SaaS space, and before that I taught business English in Japan for four years. I'm currently the President of the <%= link_to('Interaction Design Association', 'https://ixda.org') %>, have an MBA from the  <%= link_to('Weatherhead School of Management', 'https://weatherhead.case.edu') %>, a BA in Technocultural Studies from <%= link_to('Oberlin College', 'https://oberlin.edu') %>, and am a Professional Certified Coach through the <%= link_to('The International Coaching Federation', 'https://coachingfederation.org/') %>.

    <p><strong>Land Acknowledgement:</strong> I reside on the unceded ancestral homeland of the <%= link_to('Ramaytush Ohlone', 'https://www.ramaytush.org') %> peoples who are the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula. With deepest respect to the Ancestors, Elders and Relatives of the Ramaytush Community, I affirm their sovereign rights as First Peoples. I am committed to dismantling ongoing legacies of settler colonialism and white supremacy through study, service, donations, Yunakin Land Tax, and my own inner-work. </p>

    <p>I am passionate about working with people, teams, and companies who are committed to creative ways of leading (and living) in this volatile and uncertain world. People who believe that business can be an instrument for positive change and that work can be filled with intention, meaning, and joy. If you are longing to live at the intersection of purpose and passion, if you are ready to take the next giant step in your leadership journey, and if you are ready to listen deeply to what is calling to you, <%= link_to("let's talk", 'consultation' )%>.</p>
