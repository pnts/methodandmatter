    <p>I am the daughter of Anne Wylie and Walter Mignolo, granddaughter of Elizabeth, Andrew, Nieves, and Domingo, and life-partner to Jayson. I am a descendent of ancestors who once lived in Hungary, Italy, Scotland, and Germany and am a citizen of the United States and Argentina.</p>

    <p><strong>My work supports people to be more present and whole so that they can participate fully in life.</strong></p>

    <p>I serve leaders and teams who sense that these times call for different ways of seeing and being in organizations. I support them in developing capacities for new kinds of attention and awareness, helping them navigate complexity while staying connected to what matters most.</p>

    <p>I write a joyfully irregular newsletter called <%= link_to('the becoming', 'the-becoming') %> about remembering and reinhabiting ourselves as participants in the ongoing creation of the world, as well as <%= link_to('Words Make Worlds', 'words-make-worlds') %> &mdash; a roughly bi-weekly newsletter dedicated to the art, science, and craft of the Coaching Leadership Style. I also run <%= link_to('Leader as Coach', 'leader-as-coach') %>, a seven week cohort-based course for executives that want to 10x their leadership practice.</p>

    <p>Outside of coaching I am a <%= link_to('fully certified Realization Process teacher', 'https://realizationprocess.org') %>, an <%= link_to('avid backcountry camper', 'https://www.nps.gov/subjects/camping/backcountry-camping.htm') %>, and a <%= link_to('budding martial artist', 'https://plumblossom.net/ChoyLiFut/') %>.</p>
