    <p>Over the last two decades I've had a pretty winding career path: testing video games, overseeing the digital side of Free Speech TV, teaching business English in Japan, and building product at multiple tech start-ups with two exits and one currently at unicorn status. Since 2021 I've been an executive coach working with leaders and teams that care <em>so deeply</em> that they lose themselves in the process. Through our work together they remember who they uniquely are, regain executive confidence, and lead with creative clarity.</p>

    <p>I work one-on-one with clients, coach executive teams, run group coaching programs, and design leadership development curriculum for organizations.</p>

    <p>I write a monthly newsletter called <%= link_to('the becoming', 'the-becoming') %> about leadership, change, and being human, as well as <%= link_to('Words Make Worlds', 'words-make-worlds') %> &mdash; a bi-weekly newsletter dedicated to the art, science, and craft of the Coaching Leadership Style. I also run <%= link_to('Leader as Coach', 'leader-as-coach') %>, a six week cohort-based course for executives that want to 10x their leadership practice.</p>

    <p>Outside of coaching I am a <%= link_to('fully certified Realization Process teacher', 'https://realizationprocess.org') %>, an <%= link_to('avid backcountry camper', 'https://www.nps.gov/subjects/camping/backcountry-camping.htm') %>, and a <%= link_to('budding martial artist', 'https://plumblossom.net/ChoyLiFut/') %>.</p>
