    <h3>This 60-minute webinar introduces the Leadership Fluency framework and gives you a sense of what the work entails.</h3>

    <p>Covering the distinctions between four fundamental leadership roles (leading, directing, managing, and coaching) and walking you through a diagnostic process for reading what situations actually need, you'll learn how to move from “this feels kind of unclear” to identifying specific intervention points and choosing your response consciously rather than defaulting to habit.</p>

    <p>The webinar includes a downloadable workbook with the diagnostic template, framework reference materials, and practical next steps for building your leadership fluency.</p>
