    <h2>How I Came to Coaching</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>The first time I stepped into an executive role I had no idea what I was doing. I cared about the company and knew my functional role inside and and out, but struggled to connect with other parts of the business and build strategic relationships which had a negative impact on my ability to influence and execute. </p>

    <p>Thankfully, instead of firing me the company suggested I hire an executive coach to help sort things out. I reached out to <%= link_to('Jerry Colonna', 'https://reboot.io') %> who put me in touch with the incredibly talented <%= link_to('Miriam Meima', 'https://evolution.team/miriam-meima') %>.</p>

    <p>When I first started working with Miriam I thought I would bring my challenges to her and she'd give me a framework or process that would help me overcome that challenge. Instead, she turned my attention to what was happening in my inner world. I began to see the conditioned tendencies and automatic ways of responding that were significantly hindering my capacity to show up as an executive. As it turned out, these patterns were also hindering how I showed up in the rest of my life.</p>

    <p>Through our work together I began to see and relate to challenges in new and different ways. I became more impactful and effective, and less reactive and territorial. And more importantly, I began to learn what my own unique leadership style looked like.

    <p>I was floored.</p>

    <p>The inner work had fully transformed my ability to show up as a leader. Of course we also focused on the outer work, but without the inner work everything else would have lead to incremental change at best. But with the inner work, what happened was transformational.</p>

    <p>I want everyone to be able to experience how the challenges we face at work can be rich material for deeper transformation. To see how patterns that inhibit us with our colleagues are probably having the same effect in other parts of our lives. And to experience all of this with the support of someone who fully believes in you and your innate wholeness. </p>

    <p>Since working with Miriam I've had the opportunity to be coached by some amazing folks, including <%= link_to('Marty Janowitz', 'https://www.martyjanowitz.com') %>, <%= link_to('Marina Illich', 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/marina-illich-ph-d-999a355/') %>, and <%= link_to('Sahar Azarabadi', 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/sazarabadi/') %>. I share these names as a way of saying, I believe in the power of coaching because I've been there, and I know what great coaching looks like because I've been coached (and continue to be coached) by some of the best. </p>
