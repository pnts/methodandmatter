    <h2>Beginning Together: The Intake Session</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>It all begins with the intake session. Though we probably have a sense of where our work together will start based on the initial consultation session, intentional beginnings are an important part of building the coaching container. Intake is a chance to engage in a holistic exploration of who you are, what is calling, and what gets in your way. This session runs 90 minutes and will set the foundation and initial direction of our work. From this conversation we'll create a purpose statement that answers the question, "coaching for the sake of what?" and identify any developmental outcomes that will support the leader you are becoming. You'll also receive:</p>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li><strong>A Kick-off Email:</strong> a welcome and overview of what to expect, what comes next, and any relevant links, readings, and tools  </li>
      <li><strong>An Enneagram Assessment:</strong> the Enneagram is a great way to kick-start the introspection process and identify key strengths as well as behaviors that might be in your way</li>
      <li><strong>Intake Questions:</strong> a set of questions that we'll explore together in the intake </li>
      <li><strong>Coaching Manual:</strong> a collection of frameworks, models, and methods I use in my coaching practice, which also includes information on how to best utilize your executive coach (hi!)</li>
      <li><strong>First Invoice:</strong> invoices can be paid monthly or quarterly (see more on billing below)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequency and Cadence</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>Typically we'll meet <strong>every-other week for 60 minutes</strong> either via phone or Zoom, though sessions can go longer depending on your needs. I will send a check-in email 48 hours before our session with a set of questions to help us identify the most impactful use of our time together. Sessions must be used in the month in which they occur. </p>

    <h2>Inbetween Sessions</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>Coaching doesn't just happen in the moments we're together, it also happens in the rich time between sessions. At the end of each session we'll reflect on what we've uncovered, and from these insights we'll craft experiments, reflective exercises, practices and action items for you to take out into the world. The intention is to put new ways of being into practice and create feedback loops that can accelerate learning and transformation, practiced in a safe and supportive way.</p>

    <p>I'm always available between sessions via text and email. In your welcome materials you'll also receive a link you can use to schedule spot coaching sessions (30 minutes) as needed.</p>

    <h2>Engagement Length</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>While I no longer work with a set length of time for coaching engagements, I am looking to work with people who are serious about their own personal and professional development. I ask that you commit to three months of working together, at which point we will stop and assess how it's going and decide whether to continue or stop. Typically folks work with me for around 9 - 12 months.</p>
