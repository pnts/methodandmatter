    <blockquote>
      <p>Before working with Andi and Donna, we were an overworked, reactive executive team. Through learning and iterating on our leadership styles, we’ve pivoted to being intentional about how we lead.</p>

      <p>Slowing down has helped us get more done. It’s a much better work atmosphere for everyone across the board. We smile more. And we see more engagement across our company.</p>

    <h3>Team coaching takes a systems-based approach to helping teams work better together.</h3>

    <p>In this work, the team system itself—an original, inseparable whole—is the focus of coaching and development, rather than the individuals who make up the team. The objective is to increase the team's capacity to lead in connection with its vision, purpose, and desired goals.</p>

    <p>Unlike trainings that focus on skill transfer or consulting that provides solutions, team coaching builds capacity through direct experience. We raise awareness of your patterns of interaction, observe how you engage with each other, and experiment with new ways of working together. Through this experiential approach, you discover not just what to change, but how to evolve as a living system.</p>

    <p>The core principles of team coaching:</p>

    <h3>1. The Team System Has Its Own Intelligence</h3>
    <p>Every team creates something unique through their interactions—patterns of communication, unspoken agreements, collective moods, and shared blind spots. This "third entity" (the team itself) has needs, behaviors, and potential that are distinct from any individual member. Just as you can't understand a jazz ensemble by studying each musician separately, you can't understand a team without experiencing how they create together. We work with this collective intelligence, helping it become more conscious and intentional.</p>

    <h3>2. Everything That Happens is Data</h3>
    <p>In team coaching, there are no mistakes—only information. The moment someone checks their phone during a difficult conversation? Data. The way silence falls after certain topics arise? Data. Who speaks first, who never speaks, how decisions really get made versus how they're supposed to get made? All data. We observe these patterns together, with curiosity rather than judgment, because awareness itself creates the conditions for change.</p>

    <h3>3. The System Will Reveal What It Needs</h3>
    <p>Teams, like all living systems, move toward health when given the right conditions. You don't need an outside expert to tell you what's wrong or prescribe solutions. Through experiential exercises, real-time observation, and collective reflection, your team's wisdom emerges. The breakthrough insights come from within the team itself. My role is to create the container and process that allows this revelation to unfold.</p>

    <h3>4. Change Happens Through Experience, Not Explanation</h3>
    <p>You can't think your way into being a better team. You have to experience new ways of being together. So we experiment in real time. Maybe we try a different way of making decisions, or we slow down to notice what's happening beneath the surface of your discussions. We might explore what happens when the usual voices step back and quieter members step forward. Through these lived experiences, new possibilities become real rather than theoretical.</p>

    <h3>5. Relationship Patterns are Leadership Patterns</h3>
    <p>How your team relates is how your team leads. The dynamics between you—trust, conflict, power, vulnerability—these aren't separate from your "real work." They are the foundation that determines what's possible. A team that can't navigate conflict together can't innovate. A team without trust can't take risks. By evolving how you relate, you expand your collective capacity to lead and create impact.</p>
