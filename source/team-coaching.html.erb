  <div class="col-2">
    <p>Built on the principles and foundations of individual coaching, team coaching integrates a holistic, systems-based approach to helping teams work better together.</p>

    <p>It all begins with an opening. Something isn't working, the team is facing a new challenge, the team has grown and needs a reset, whatever it is something feels off, or amiss. Through in-depth interviews with team members and stakeholders, we'll start to get a sense of what the underlying issues, challenges, and stuck-ness might be.
    </p>

    <p>The coaching program, ranging from unstructured to highly structured depending on the needs of the team, is completely customized to help the team step into new ways of working together, including communication, commitments, identity, culture, purpose, and power, both within the team, and in the ways the team interacts with other parts of the organization.</p>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p class="quote">"I used to believe that it was impossible to work with people who all respected, cared for, supported, and empathized with one another. That to see one another as people, not just coworkers, was impossible. You’ve proven me so wrong. You have built an exceptional thing - a thing that I used to believe couldn’t exist... you have built a culture of kindness, strength, and vulnerability, that encourages us to sit in our discomfort, to cry, to feel mad, but then to take action, to be confident in ourselves and our principles. You’ve also shown us how to celebrate, have fun, be silly, and not take ourselves too seriously! And at the end of the day, how to share both our value and our joy."</p>
    <p class="source">- design researcher</p>

    <p class="quote">"This team you've cultivated has invited me to live among concepts that other environments suggest are at odds with each other: to center both my vulnerability and my strengths, practice both deeper introspection and deeper empathy, feel both safe and challenged, become both more present and less afraid to step back, and embrace both the joy of play and the serious work of personal growth. I am a richer person for this every day, and I sure am happy to imagine the many more people you will make feel this way."</p>
