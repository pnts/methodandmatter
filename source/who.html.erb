  <div class="col-2">
    <p>I coach senior leaders, executives, and teams who sense that these times call for different ways of seeing and being in organizations. I partner with people who feel the tension between business-as-usual expectations and the deeper currents of change moving through our world, who are ready to develop new capacities for attention, awareness, and leadership.</p>

    <h3>You Believe...</h3>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>that beneath metrics and OKRs lies an invitation to work differently</li>
        <li>that organizational life can contribute to wider systemic flourishing</li>
        <li>that wisdom emerges through deep listening and attunement</li>
        <li>that slowing down creates the conditions for deeper awareness</li>
        <li>that business can be regenerative rather than extractive</li>
        <li>that organizations can be places of genuine transformation</li>
        <li>that leadership includes tending to the systems we're part of</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>You are ready and willing to... </h3>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>explore different ways of seeing and being in organizations</li>
        <li>listen deeply to what is emerging in and around you</li>
        <li>develop new capacities for attention and awareness</li>
        <li>question familiar patterns and assumptions</li>
        <li>see how you are implicated in larger systems</li>
        <li>engage in practices of attunement</li>
        <li>be accountable for your own transformation</li>
        <li>stay curious in the face of complexity</li>
        <li>find joy in the journey of discovery</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>You long for...</h3>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>ways to navigate complexity with wisdom and care</li>
          <li>authentic connection with your team and the wider world</li>
          <li>clarity about your unique role in these transformative times</li>
          <li>space to attend to what matters most</li>
          <li>the capacity to work differently in times of great change</li>
          <li>wisdom to lead through uncertainty and emergence</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>I'm likely not the right coach if you are...</h3>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>seeking quick fixes or tactical solutions</li>
        <li>wanting to maintain business-as-usual approaches</li>
        <li>looking for a conventional leadership playbook</li>
        <li>resistant to exploring different ways of seeing and being</li>
        <li>unwilling to question familiar patterns and assumptions</li>
        <li>expecting transformation without personal investment</li>
        <li>solely focused on metrics and shareholder value</li>
        <li>uncomfortable with uncertainty and emergence</li>
      </ul>

    <p>If any of these resonate more strongly than the “You Believe...” statements above, we might not be the right fit for each other.</p>
