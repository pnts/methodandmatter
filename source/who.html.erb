    <h2>Who I Work With</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>I coach senior leaders, executives, and teams who want to be in work (and life) with more capacity, presence, clarity, and joy. I partner with people who know it is possible to be more effective and fulfilled in their roles and who are looking for deeper meaning and purpose in their work.</p>

    <h3>You Believe...</h3>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>that well-being is critical to the success of high performing teams</li>
        <li>that business is about profit <em>and</em> people</li>
        <li>that being curious provides greater leverage than being right</li>
        <li>that slowing down creates the conditions to go fast</li>
        <li>that work doesn't have to destroy us</li>
        <li>that work can be an expression of our full creativity and aliveness</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>You are ready and willing to... </h3>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>be open, honest, and vulnerable (and I will do the same)</li>
        <li>listen to what is calling and let go of what no longer serves</li>
        <li>put in the time and effort that coaching requires</li>
        <li>let go of old habits and beliefs</li>
        <li>see how you are complicit in the challenges you face</li>
        <li>engage in experiments</li>
        <li>be accountable for your own transformation</li>
        <li>to have fun in the process!</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>You long for...</h3>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>a deeper connection with your team, colleagues, and peers</li>
          <li>confidence and clarity in your unique leadership practice</li>
          <li>the space to engage in more strategic thinking</li>
          <li>more joy and meaning in your work</li>
          <li>the alchemy to transmute challenges into transformation and growth</li>
        </ul>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>There are certain situations, desires, and goals that my coaching is not a good fit for:</p>

    <h3>If you are...</h3>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>looking to address a one-off tactical issue</li>
        <li>looking for confirmation that you are right</li>
        <li>looking for a playbook to get your next promotion</li>
        <li>unwilling to take a hard and honest look at yourself and your behaviors</li>
        <li>unwilling to put in the time and effort coaching requires...</li>
        <li>...or expect me to do the work for you</li>
      </ul>

    <p>If any of the above hold a kernel of truth for you, then we probably won't be a good fit for each other.</p>
