    <h3>Week 2 - Making Observations and Working with Emotions</h3>
    <p>Learn how to make grounded observations based on data to facilitate increased awareness in a learning conversation. And learn what emotions are and how to work with them in organizational settings to build trust and create psychological safety.</p>

    <h3>Week 3 - Listening and Asking Questions</h3>
    <p>The ability to utilize several forms of listening combined with an understanding of the anatomy of powerful questions gives coaches the ability to facilitate change in others. By the end of this lesson students will have experience with different levels of listening and proficiency with asking open and honest questions in service of creating space for others to think.</p>
