    <h2>Why This Course?</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <blockquote><p>This has been one of the most valuable courses I've taken for leadership & management&mdash;it unlocked a lot of realizations for myself and how I interact with people both professionally and personally to help me become a much better leader with coaching ability going forward! <span class="blockquote-right">&mdash; Director of Operations</span></p> </blockquote>

    <p>Leading people is messy! Leaders succeed in their roles, at least initially, with technical skills, but human dynamics are where leadership really shines.</p>

    <p>You've probably felt it—that moment that calls for feedback but something holds you back. The conversation that keeps getting pushed to "next week." The team member with potential who isn't growing because you're too busy putting out fires. Or maybe the exhaustion that comes from carrying everyone else's problems while your own work piles up.</p>

    <p>These aren't signs you're failing as a leader. They're signs you're ready for a different approach.</p>

    <p>Leader as Coach is a seven-week journey that transforms how you show up for your team. Through experiential learning you'll develop the presence, skills, and confidence to:</p>

    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Transform difficult conversations from something you dread to something you embrace</li>
      <li>Help your team find their own answers instead of constantly looking to you for solutions</li>
      <li>Replace burnout with a sustainable leadership practice that energizes you</li>
      <li>Build the kind of trust where honesty strengthens relationships instead of threatening them</li>
      <li>Know when to coach and when to direct—and how to do both with intention</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This isn't about adding more to your plate. It's about changing how you approach what's already there. Past participants report not just professional growth, but a profound shift in how leadership feels—less draining, more energizing, and ultimately more impactful.</p>

    <p>In a small cohort of peers facing similar challenges, you'll practice real-world conversations, receive thoughtful feedback, and build a toolkit of approaches that feel authentic to you. No generic management advice or one-size-fits-all solutions—just practical wisdom you can immediately apply.</p>

    <p>If you're ready to stop avoiding difficult conversations and start having meaningful ones, to develop your team's potential rather than doing their work, and to lead with both courage and sustainability, Leader as Coach is your next step.</p>
