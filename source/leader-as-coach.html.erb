    <h2>Why This Course?</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">

    <p>Coaching is a comprehensive approach to leadership that transforms working relationships through learning conversations that impact individuals, teams, and business outcomes. In learning the foundations of coaching, leaders become better at delegating, creating shared agreements, providing feedback, and leading with clarity resulting in more impact (and happier teams) with less effort.</p>


    <p>Coaching in organizations is different than professional coaching - managers and leaders must know when to coach and how to keep learning inline with business needs. There is also a magnitude of difference between learning coaching frameworks through books (which are great!) and getting the hands-on experience practicing coaching in a safe container.</p>

    <h2>Syllabus</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <h3>Week 1 - The Foundations of Coaching</h3>
    <p>To have effective and impactful coaching conversations, leaders must first make a shift in their mindset and approach. Foundations introduces students to the idea of a "coaching presence" and builds skill in the ability to utilize the self - presence, awareness, attention, and values - as impactful tools for coaching.</p>

    <h3>Week 2 - Listening and Asking Questions</h3>
    <p>The ability to utilize several forms of listening combined with an understanding of the anatomy of powerful questions gives coaches the ability to facilitate change in others. By the end of this lesson students will have experience with different levels of listening and proficiency with asking open and honest questions in service of creating space for others to think.</p>

    <h3>Week 3 - Emotions and Feedback</h3>
    <p>Emotions are essential to our daily living - without emotions we'd never be able to make even the simplest of decisions! But it can be challenging to know how to work with emotions in a business environment, and feedback conversations have a good chance of unleashing various emotions. Learn about what emotions are, what information they have to share, and how to create feedback conversations that invite curiosity and learning, rather than resentment and conflict.</p>

    <h3>Week 4 - The Coaching Conversation</h3>
    <p>Session four is fully focused on the process of coaching from beginning to end. Utilizing a simple framework along with tools and methods from previous sessions, students are guided through each phase of a coaching conversation with structure and support. By the end of our time together, students will have an understanding of how the coaching process works and what makes coaching different from everyday conversations.</p>

    <h3>Week 5 - The Coaching Conversation at Work</h3>
    <p>Building off of session four, this class digs deeper into the role of coaching conversations in an organizational context. Through the use of case studies students learn how coaching works alongside the roles of leading and managing and building proficiency in how coaching can be used to generate greater accountability.</p>

    <h3>Week 6 - Integration</h3>
    <p>In our final session we bring everything together from the past five weeks. We'll cover some additional tools for your coaching toolbox, explore what it takes to build a coaching friendly culture, and create learning plans for what comes next in your development as a leader who coaches.</p>

    <h2>What People Are Saying</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <blockquote>
      <p>
      This thoughtful, well-designed course fills a critical gap in existing Leadership training and curricula: a cohort-based, short-term immersive program for leaders that effectively coexists alongside the busy schedules and competing priorities that often get in the way of leaders’ ability to focus on their professional growth & development. The agenda has a great flow, with dedicated time for active participation and practice of the frameworks introduced – both as a full cohort and in breakout groups. And the Leader’s Little Book of Coaching is a valuable companion for ongoing support of Leaders and their commitment to integrating coaching skills into their leadership repertoire.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Andi does such an amazing job at slowing you down and reframing the way you approach problems in a positive, conscious way. The course materials are invaluable, and the experiential learning was the best out of any course or leadership education I've been through. I felt really close to my cohort by the end, and have already started implementing pieces of the training with my direct reports. Looking forward to seeing how this framework can help me empower my team!</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I recently joined a Leader as Coach cohort and learned what it means to coach. Andi is a fantastic instructor who gave us powerful tools, exercises, and examples. Going into this training, I knew very little about coaching aside from it's different from mentoring. After completing the course, I walked away with a much deeper understanding of coaching and techniques I can immediately use. I highly recommend working with Andi to incorporate coaching into your skillset and improve your communication with others.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Andrea's thoughtful approach, calm presence and immense knowledge on coaching and leadership really make for such a valuable, insightful experience. The things you learn about “leader as coach” are immediately applicable while likeminded souls in similar fields make for interesting cohorts to learn with. 10 out of 10 recommend!
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        I really enjoyed the course and I would definitely recommend it to anyone that want to become a better leader, coach, manager and combine those 3 things more effectively. Even if some of the lessons happened after a long day at work, I always finished the videocall feeling renewed, energised, ready to try new things with my team the next day.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>If you've ever wondered whether there's a more thoughtful and nurturing way to lead, the answer is yes. I truly loved this course. Andi has a way of slowing you down, observing and noticing to build your EQ to the next level and then ground you in a leadership practice that's build on a coaching approach to allow you and your team to succeed.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Leader as Coach is a fantastic course. Andrea is a wonderful teacher who provided valuable tools and models for the students. I appreciated the role playing which helped cement the theory.</p>

    <h2>Leader as Coach: 12 Skills</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p></p>
    <ol class="skills">
      <li>
        <h3>The Power of Presence</h3>
        <p>Your most powerful coaching tool isn’t a framework or methodology, it is <em>you</em>. How you show up matters.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Always Be Curious</h3>
        <p>We never know it all. Staying curious is the practice of uncovering more of the picture so that new actions can be taken, and new results achieved.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>It's All About Learning</h3>
        <p>Coaching conversations are about learning from experience &mdash; about how we impact the world, and how the world impacts us.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Listen Beyond the Words</h3>
        <p>Words point to the content of a situation. Tone, gesture, body posture, energy, pace, and other non-verbal cues hold important information about the context. Listen for both.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Know Where You Are</h3>
        <p>The state of your nervous system impacts how you see the world and how you coach others. Are you open to learning, or are you committed to being right?</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Build Partnership</h3>
        <p>Coaching is a relationship built on true partnership, where power and responsibility are shared. The coach trusts in the capacity people have to find their own solutions.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Begin Well</h3>
        <p>Beginnings set the stage for the conversation that follows. Knowing how to tend to and structure a beginning sets everyone up for success.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Explore Together</h3>
        <p>Coaching is about raising awareness around an opportunity or challenge so that new possibilities emerge. Open and honest questions guide the exploration.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Create Possibilities</h3>
        <p>Utilize reframing, distinctions, metaphors, and even resistance to uncover new ways of seeing and new possibilities for action.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Conclude with Clarity</h3>
        <p>With increased awareness and possibilities, what new actions can be taken? What experiments can be run? What timeline feels supportive? Complete the conversation and allow the work to conclude.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Mind the Path</h3>
        <p>Coaching conversations are filled with “oh sh*t” moments. Learn some of the common obstacles to coaching and how to handle them, so you know what to do when things go off track.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Accountability <span class="amp">&</span> Progress</h3>
        <p>Coaching empowers people to take action to achieve the results they want. Accountability often increases with coaching conversations, especially when coaching is consistent over time.</p>
      </li>
