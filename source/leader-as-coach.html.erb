    <p>I believe that coaching is a fundamental skill that makes us better leaders. In learning the foundations of coaching, leaders become better at delegating, creating shared agreements, providing feedback, and leading with clarity. And the self-awareness that is built in the process becomes the engine for future growth, both personally and professionally.</p>

    <h2>What People Are Saying</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <blockquote>
      <p>
      This thoughtful, well-designed course fills a critical gap in existing Leadership training and curricula: a cohort-based, short-term immersive program for leaders that effectively coexists alongside the busy schedules and competing priorities that often get in the way of leadersâ€™ ability to focus on their professional growth & development. The agenda has a great flow, with dedicated time for active participation and practice of the frameworks introduced â€“ both as a full cohort and in breakout groups. And the Leaderâ€™s Little Book of Coaching is a valuable companion for ongoing support of Leaders and their commitment to integrating coaching skills into their leadership repertoire.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Andi does such an amazing job at slowing you down and reframing the way you approach problems in a positive, conscious way. The course materials are invaluable, and the experiential learning was the best out of any course or leadership education I've been through. I felt really close to my cohort by the end, and have already started implementing pieces of the training with my direct reports. Looking forward to seeing how this framework can help me empower my team!</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I recently joined a Leader as Coach cohort and learned what it means to coach. Andi is a fantastic instructor who gave us powerful tools, exercises, and examples. Going into this training, I knew very little about coaching aside from it's different from mentoring. After completing the course, I walked away with a much deeper understanding of coaching and techniques I can immediately use. I highly recommend working with Andi to incorporate coaching into your skillset and improve your communication with others.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I canâ€™t say enough good things about Andi and her way of coaching in this course ðŸ’œ What I found especially helpful:

        âœ¨ All the small, simple tools and tips you learn to bring about the best in yourself and your colleagues/team, superrich learning material
        âœ¨ Learning with and from other designers with similar challenges in their (team lead) work
        âœ¨ Very good balance between time investment (short) and what you learn (lots)
        âœ¨ Andreaâ€™s presence canâ€™t be beat
        âœ¨ Andreaâ€™s interest in ontological design and decolonizing design shine through in her way of coaching

    <p></p>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li><strong>Understand what coaching is and its role in organizations </strong><br/>
      Coaching is both an art and a science, but it certainly isn't a mystery! This course will demystify coaching, clarify the role it plays in organizations, and provide leaders with a clear understanding of how to coach in business environments.</li>

      <li><strong>Know when to coach and when not to</strong><br/>
      Coaching is action oriented and future focused. In some situations coaching is the right move, while others require leaders to be strategic and directive. Learn where coaching conversations work best, and when to use a different communication approach.</li>

      <li><strong>Build fluency in the neuroscience of coaching</strong><br/>
        Stress is good in the right amount, but too much can push people into survival mode. When this happens a shift from being responsive to reactive takes place. Learn how the brain contributes to threat-based behavior and how to effectively and gracefully handle these situations.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Integrate coaching skills into your leadership practice</strong><br />
        Coaching skills are great for coaching, and are also powerful leadership skills on their own. Fluency with active listening, building relationships, making clear requests, and navigating complexity will make you a more effective leader.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Gain hands on experience coaching and being coached</strong> <br />
        Each workshop is designed with ample time dedicated to hands on, experiential learning where participants can engage in coaching and being coached. This is the best way to learn the core skills of coaching. People usually find this both scary and fun!
      </li>

      <li><strong>Increase capacity to engage in more meaningful interactions</strong> <br />
      Use coaching skills to deepen your awareness, power of observation, and leadership presence to build authentic relationships through which to coordinate action and effective performance.</li>
