    <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">

    <h3>People usually come to coaching seeking support in achieving audacious goals or when some kind of stuckness is showing up that isn't getting resolved. More often than not the two are interrelated.</h3>

    <p>With executive coaching this can look like: creating radical clarity and focus, leveling up your leadership game, working with power, developing executive presence, having difficult conversations, working the inner-critic, imposter syndrome, building high performing teams, and leading through change (to name a few). Sometimes it can also mean a transition into a new role, organization, or career.</p>

    <p>We start with where you are and look at where you long to be. I see us as partners and co-creators in this work, but you are always in the driver's seat. My role is to fully <em>see</em> you and reflect what has become invisible through repeated familiarity. The deep grooves of secret strengths and limiting beliefs that over time have become your default way of being. By looking at how you interpret the world and organize yourself in response, we will uncover the narrative of who you are today and who you are becoming. This becoming is in service to your values, your fullest expression, your innate wholeness, and the goals for the coaching engagement.</p>

    <p>With some clients I also do 360s and attend meetings in order to ground the work in observable assessments. I often recommend this because feedback from peers can be an eye-opening catalyst for where to start and what to prioritize.</p>

    <p>Tactically we will meet every week or every-other week for 60 minutes. The challenges and opportunities you face at work can be used as a catalyst to build a clear awareness of self, and the systems in which the self operates. This awarness is the foundation of choiceful and courageous leadership. By connecting to your innate resourcefulness and creativity through the three centers of intelligence - mental, emotional, and somatic - you will discover new ways of sensing and responding in this rapidly changing world.

    <p>Based on what we learn in each session, we will co-design small experiments for you to run in the working world. Experiments act as a feedback loop that can accelerate learning and transformation, practiced in a safe and supportive way. I'm available between sessions via text and email, and 30 minute spot coaching sessions can be scheduled as needed. </p>

    <h2>Team Coaching</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <h3>Whether your team is stuck or just wanting to flow better together, team coaching works with team identities, practices, and cultures to shift ways of working that lead to deeper impact and stronger outcomes.  </h3>

    <p>Built on the principles and foundations of individual coaching, team coaching integrates a holistic, systems-based approach to helping teams work better together.</p>

    <p>It all begins with an opening. Something isn't working, the team is facing a new challenge, the team has grown and needs a reset, whatever it is something feels off, or amiss. Through in-depth interviews with team members and stakeholders, we'll start to get a sense of what the underlying issues, challenges, and stuck-ness might be.
    </p>

    <p>The coaching program, ranging from unstructured to highly structured depending on the needs of the team, is completely customized to help the team step into new ways of working together, including communication, commitments, identity, culture, purpose, and power, both within the team, and in the ways the team interacts with other parts of the organization.</p>

    <h2>Group Coaching</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <h3>Group coaching combines the power of action learning and integral coaching to support leaders in creatively tackling the challenges they face while practicing the skills they need on the job.</h3>

    <p>Group coaching provides a safe and open space for leaders to explore challenges, develop critical skills through practice, and build deeper cross-cultural connections. I offer group coaching inside organizations that want to support cross-functional cross-cultural experiential learning. Group coaching is a powerful complement to workshops and trainings, where tools and techniques can be put into practice week after week. For these engagements I typically work with HR leadership and L&D teams to ensure full alignment with internal best-practices and areas of development.</p>
