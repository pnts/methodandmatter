    <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>My approach to coaching is broad, deep, and completely customized.</p>

    <p>People usually come to coaching when there is some kind of breakdown or stuck-ness showing up in their life that isn't getting resolved. With executive coaching this can look like needing to level-up your leadership game, build resilience, develop executive presence, have difficult conversations, quite the inner-critic, manage teams, and lead through change (to name a few). Sometimes it can also mean a transition into a new role, organization, or career.</p>

    <p>Whatever you come to coaching with, the goal, outcome, or possibility you long for becomes the foundation of our coaching container. From there, everything is designed specifically around your own way of being in the world. Some people prefer more structure and a formal coaching program. Others prefer less structure and work more comfortably with an “unfolding” approach. A bi-weekly meeting cadence combined with email and text support builds the container in purposeful way to facilitate your development both personally and professionally.</p>

    <p>I bring a wide range of training, education, and experience to coaching. <%= link_to('Integral Coaching', 'https://newventureswest.com') %> and <%= link_to('Integral Unfoldment', 'https://integralunfoldment.com') %> are the foundation of my coaching approach. I use organizational design and strengths-based change theories  from my <%= link_to('MBA', 'https://weatherhead.case.edu') %>  (as well as business thinking), embodiment and meditation approaches from the <%= link_to('Realization Process', 'https://realizationprocess.org') %>, breathing and yoga practices informed by <%= link_to('Parayoga', 'https://www.parayoga.com') %>, ongoing work in <%= link_to('racial healing', 'https://www.ticiess.com/racial-healing-allies') %> and <%= link_to('decolonizing practices', 'https://www.mitelnexwleadershipsociety.org/individuals') %>, as well as extensive experience building and running product and design teams at the executive level.</p>

    <p>Typical engagements run 6 - 12 months. For this type of work, a minimum of 6 months is recommended.</p>

    <h2>Team Coaching</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>Whether your team is stuck or just wanting to flow better together, team coaching works with team identities, practices, and cultures to shift ways of working that lead to deeper impact and stronger outcomes.  </p>

    <p>Built on the principles and foundations of individual coaching, team coaching integrates a holistic, systems-based approach to helping teams work better together.</p>

    <p>It all begins with an opening. Something isn't working, the team is facing a new challenge, the team has grown and needs a reset, whatever it is something feels off, or amiss. Through in-depth interviews with team members and stakeholders, we'll start to get a sense of what the underlying issues, challenges, and stuck-ness might be.
    </p>

    <p>The coaching program, ranging from unstructured to highly structured depending on the needs of the team, is completely customized to help the team step into new ways of working together, including communication, commitments, identity, culture, purpose, and power, both within the team, and in the ways the team interacts with other parts of the organization.</p>

    <h2>Group Coaching</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>Group coaching combines the power of action learning and integral development coaching to support leaders in creatively tackling the challenges they face while practicing the skills they need on the job. Group coaching provides a safe and open space for managers to explore challenges, develop critical skills through practice, and build deeper cross-cultural connections.</p>
