The intuition is there, but my brain is just not able to fully grasp and articulate what I am sensing. What are the generative mechanisms of worlding?

Yuk Hui’s idea of Cosmotechnics speaks to how cosmologies reveal what is possible with technology. In China, where the relationship between man and universe is x, technology as we conceive of it in the West isn’t possible. Here, with our Promethean origins (was this the story), dominance over nature is baked in.

But Maturana talks about, in explaining the biology of cognition says that, “through this ongoing recursiveness, every world brought forth necessarily hides its origins… the business of living keeps no records concerning origins. All we can do is generate explanations, through language, that reveal the mechanism of bringing forth a world.”

So, is it that what we are beginning to triangulate is that the method of action here is to language the mechanisms through which we bring forth worlds?
