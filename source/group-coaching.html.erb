    <h3>Group coaching combines the power of action learning and integral coaching to support leaders in creatively tackling the challenges they face while practicing the skills they need on the job.</h3>

    <p>Group coaching provides a safe and open space for leaders to explore challenges, develop critical skills through practice, and build deeper cross-cultural connections. I offer group coaching inside organizations that want to support cross-functional, cross-cultural experiential learning. Group coaching is a powerful complement to workshops and trainings, where tools and techniques can be put into practice week after week. For these engagements I typically work with HR leadership and L&D teams to ensure full alignment with internal best-practices and areas of development.</p>
