      <h2>Does it sometimes feel like you have to be someone youâ€™re not in order to be an effective leader?</h2>

      <h3>Youâ€™ve worked hard to get here. Some days youâ€™re on fireâ€”hitting your stride, showing up powerfully, communicating clearly, and seeing the impact of your work. Other days you leave meetings reactive and exhausted, wondering where your confidence went.</h3>

      <h3>This push-pull between flow and frustration is common on the leadership journey. The good news? You don't need another leadership model to squeeze yourself into. You need practices that help you show up with presence, build trust, and drive resultsâ€”all while staying true to who you are.</h3>

        <p>I wrote this short eBook after working with 100s of leaders who wanted to have more effective and purposeful conversations at work. Less framework for what to say, more how to show up relationally with your team, colleagues, and peers. <br/><br/>
