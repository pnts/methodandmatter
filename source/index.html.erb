    <h2>You don't have to go it alone.</h2>
    <p class="lead">Your leadership journey is unique, but it doesn't have to be lonely. If you are feeling stuck, challenged, or uncertain, working with a coach - a trusted partner and loyal ally - can open up new worlds of possibility, impact, and effectiveness.</p>

    <p>Working at the intersection of business, design, leadership, and people, I combine integral coaching with appreciative inquiry, design thinking, organziational design, and business strategy to help leaders flourish. </p>

    <p>I speak frequently on the topic of design leadership, business strategy, culture, design thinking, and management. I am incredibly passionate about the power of design and how it can be applied to the challenges that we face in our organizations. Using real-world experiences and case studies I hope to inspire new approaches to how we think about work.  </p>

    <p class="quote"><em>Working with Andi for almost a year helped me evaluate how I approached both my personal and professional lives, and understand what was getting me stuck. She is wise, compassionate and without judgment, but firm in providing the push I needed to make the right changes. I now approach things with much more intentionality and I continue to apply  the tools Andi provided me with. I cannot find the words to express what a transformative experience this journey has been for me.</em></p>

    <p class="quote"><em>I had the opportunity to work with Andi over the course of a year that brought a number of significant personal and professional challenges into my life. I consider myself truly fortunate to have had the benefit of Andi's support and guidance during this time. Andi is a truly gifted coach and amazing human being. Her coaching practice brings insights from the many domains she has expertise in, from design and business leadership to holistic psychology to the martial arts. Working with her has enabled me to integrate my mind and body in ways I couldn't have imagined, to face deep-seated fears and contradictions, and to emerge from my struggles as a stronger, kinder, wiser, and more resilient person. I highly recommend working with Andi to anyone who wants to move to the next level in their personal and professional life and is ready to take a leap forward in their journey of self-realization.</em></p>

    <p class="quote"><em>In my eight months with Andi, she helped me to identify my professional and personal aspirations, to develop practices that vastly improved my mental and emotional health, and to ultimately reconnect with the joy of my being. Her coaching plan was completely tailored to me, and it was always evolving with my own growth. Andi is compassionate, observant, and infinitely wise. I feel so fortunate that I was able to work with her.</em></p>
