As our thumbprints indicate, no two of us are the same. We are unique. This uniqueness, on a grand scale, means that each of us inhabits a _novel_ and partial view of the universe. According to Lee Smolin and the _causal theory of views_, this uniqueness is what allows consciousness to manifest.

On a less grand scale, the same holds true for our day to day lives. Here, the observer is made of emotions, body, and language - each of us a unique configuration at the intersection of the Venn diagram.
