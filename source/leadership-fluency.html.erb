    <h2>Why This Workshop?</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>When you step into a leadership role, you take on four distinct areas of responsibility: holding and communicating vision, defining outcomes and targets, running the business, and developing talent.</p>

    <p>What makes this hard is that most leaders can’t see clearly where their time and energy actually go across these four areas, or what’s missing from their practice.</p>

    <p>The visionary stays in vision-casting mode without translating to clear targets. The directive leader focuses on outcomes without connecting to larger purpose. The process-oriented leader builds structure without developing people's capacity. The naturally coaching leader creates space for discovery when people need decisions.</p>

    <p>This workshop helps you map your complete leadership landscape—where your time actually goes, what’s present, and what’s missing. With that clarity, you can make conscious choices about how you want to lead rather than operating from habit or overwhelm.</p>

    <h2>Who this is for</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p><strong>This workshop is designed for folks who have at least some leadership experience under their belt, whether in a management track or IC track (staff, principal, etc.).</strong></p>

    <p>Whatever your seniority, you’ve started realize that the way you lead isn’t always producing the results you want. Sometimes you leave conversations surprised by what happened (or what didn't happen) wondering where the gap in understanding, communication, or execution came from.</p>

    <p>The solution isn’t necessarily in saying things more clearly or managing more closely, but in choosing the right conversation for each situation. When leaders have the fluency to step into leading, directing, managing, and coaching as needed, conversations are transformed and results follow.</p>

    <p>This workshop serves leaders who:</p>

    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Have responsibility for teams, projects, or functions (at any level)</li>
      <li>Feel exhausted from having to manage everything so closely</li>
      <li>Want to expand their conversational capacity beyond their go-to mode</li>
      <li>Are navigating situations that require flexibility in how they show up</li>
      <li>Value experiential learning and are willing to work with their real challenges</li>
    </ul>

      <p>Whether you’re newer to leadership with a solid foundation or a seasoned executive deepening your craft, this work meets you where you are and helps you expand what’s possible.</p>

    <h2>What you can expect</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p><strong>This workshop combines experiential learning with conceptual frameworks to help you expand your leadership range in a supported environment.</strong></p>

    <p>You’ll work with real leadership challenges—both your own and case studies that mirror organizational complexity—to discover the distinctions between leading, directing, managing, and coaching through direct experience. Through hands-on practice you’ll get familiar with different approaches and observe what each reveals, building understanding that goes beyond theoretical knowledge.</p>

    <p>Through structured exercises and reflection, you’ll map your current challenges through multiple lenses to see what you might be missing. You’ll identify which conversations feel most natural to you and where you want to expand your range. This includes developing awareness of how different leadership modes appear in your body and behavior—the somatic dimension that often goes unnoticed but deeply shapes how you lead.</p>

    <p>The workshop creates space to practice all four roles in a setting where experimentation is encouraged. You’ll develop your capacity to sense what’s needed in each moment rather than automatically reverting to your go-to mode.</p>

    <p>You’ll leave with practical integration practices designed for daily leadership—ways to continue building your fluency without requiring separate development time—and a clearer awareness of your strengths, edges, and the conscious choices available to you.</p>

    <h2>Syllabus</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>Leadership Fluency is a 4-hour workshop delivered in two 2-hour sessions within the same week, allowing time for reflection and observation between sessions.</p>

    <h3>Pre-work</h3>
    <p>20 - 30 minute reflective practice to surface the dimensions of your current leadership work.</p>

    <h3>Workshop 1: The Four Roles of Leadership</h3>
    <p>Leadership is more complex than any single style or approach can contain. In this foundational workshop, you’ll be introduced to the Leadership Fluency Framework—a map of four distinct roles that every leader navigates: LEAD, DIRECT, MANAGE, and COACH. </p>

    <p>Rather than treating these as personality types or fixed identities, we explore them as distinct stances, each with its own mindset, posture, and kind of conversation, each connecting different dimensions of organizational life.</p>

    <p>Through reflection, small group work, and somatic exploration, you’ll develop an intuitive feel for what each role looks and feels like in practice. You’ll map where you currently spend your time and energy, identify your patterns and defaults, and begin to see where expanding your range could have the most impact.</p>

    <p>You leave with a clear picture of your current leadership shape—and a sense of where you want it to go.</p>

    <h3>Workshop 2: Leadership Fluency in Action</h3>
    <p>Knowing the roles is the beginning. Fluency comes from practice. In this application-focused workshop, you’ll bring the framework into contact with the real challenges, conversations, and organizational dynamics you navigate every day.</p>

    <p>We’ll explore how heuristics and conversation types can help you read a situation and consciously choose the role—or combination of roles—that the moment calls for.</p>

    <p>We’ll look at how pairs of roles lock together to create the organizational patterns that drive strategy, execution, structure, and relationships—and how to manage the tensions between them so your organization stays in motion.</p>

    <p>We’ll also zoom out to the team level, examining how leadership fluency shows up collectively and how your leadership team can work with the framework together.</p>

    <p>The workshop closes with reflection and a practical next-steps design, so you leave with real commitments for where you're taking your practice.</p>

    <h2>For Teams and Companies</h2>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p><strong>Leadership Fluency can be run in-house for leadership teams, providing both individual clarity and collective insight into your team’s leadership patterns.</strong></p>

    <p>Each person gains clarity on their own leadership landscape—where their time goes, what’s present and missing in their practice, and how they want to lead. At the same time, when a team goes through this together, you see how leadership effort is distributed across the entire team—where you’re collectively over-indexed and where gaps exist that no one is covering. This reveals systemic patterns that are invisible when looking at individual leadership practices alone.</p>

    <p><strong>Teams leave with a shared framework and language for different types of leadership work, allowing them to be more intentional about how they lead and shape work.</strong></p>

    <p>The in-house version can be customized for your organizational context—using your actual challenges, structures, and dynamics as the material for mapping and reflection.</p>
