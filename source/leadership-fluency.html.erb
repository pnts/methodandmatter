    <h2>Why This Workshop?</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>When you step into a leadership role, you take on four distinct areas of responsibility: holding and communicating vision, defining outcomes and targets, running the business, and developing talent.</p>

    <p>What makes this hard is that most leaders can’t see clearly where their time and energy actually go across these four areas, or what’s missing from their practice.</p>

    <p>The visionary stays in vision-casting mode without translating to clear targets. The directive leader focuses on outcomes without connecting to larger purpose. The process-oriented leader builds structure without developing people's capacity. The naturally coaching leader creates space for discovery when people need decisions.</p>

    <p>This workshop helps you map your complete leadership landscape—where your time actually goes, what’s present, and what’s missing. With that clarity, you can make conscious choices about how you want to lead rather than operating from habit or overwhelm.</p>

    <h2>Who this is for</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p><strong>This workshop is designed for leaders who have a foundation in leading, directing, managing, and coaching and are ready to develop greater fluency in moving between them.</strong></p>

    <p>You’ve been in a leadership role long enough to know your strengths and recognize your go-to mode. Maybe you’re a director navigating increasing complexity, a senior manager building your range, or an executive refining how you show up.</p>

    <p>Whatever your seniority, you’ve started realize that the way you lead isn’t always producing the results you want. Sometimes you leave conversations surprised by what happened (or what didn't happen) wondering where the gap in understanding, communication, or execution came from.</p>

    <p>The solution isn't necessarily in saying things more clearly or managing more closely, but in choosing the right conversation for each situation. When leaders have the fluency to step into leading, directing, managing, and coaching as needed, conversations are transformed and results follow.</p>

    <p>This workshop serves leaders who:</p>

    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Have responsibility for teams, projects, or functions (at any level)</li>
      <li>Feel exhausted from having to manage everything so closely</li>
      <li>Want to expand their conversational capacity beyond their go-to mode</li>
      <li>Are navigating situations that require flexibility in how they show up</li>
      <li>Value experiential learning and are willing to work with their real challenges</li>
    </ul>

      <p>Whether you’re newer to leadership with a solid foundation or a seasoned executive deepening your craft, this work meets you where you are and helps you expand what’s possible.</p>

    <h2>What you can expect</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p><strong>This workshop combines experiential learning with conceptual frameworks to help you expand your leadership range in a supported environment.</strong></p>

    <p>You’ll work with real leadership challenges—both your own and case studies that mirror organizational complexity—to discover the distinctions between leading, directing, managing, and coaching through direct experience. Through hands-on practice you’ll get familiar with different approaches and observe what each reveals, building understanding that goes beyond theoretical knowledge.</p>

    <p>Through structured exercises and reflection, you’ll map your current challenges through multiple lenses to see what you might be missing. You’ll identify which conversations feel most natural to you and where you want to expand your range. This includes developing awareness of how different leadership modes appear in your body and behavior—the somatic dimension that often goes unnoticed but deeply shapes how you lead.</p>

    <p>The workshop creates space to practice all four roles in a setting where experimentation is encouraged. You’ll develop your capacity to sense what’s needed in each moment rather than automatically reverting to your go-to mode.</p>

    <p>You’ll leave with practical integration practices designed for daily leadership—ways to continue building your fluency without requiring separate development time—and a clearer awareness of your strengths, edges, and the conscious choices available to you.</p>

    <h2>Syllabus</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>Leadership Fluency is a 4-hour workshop delivered in two 2-hour sessions within the same week, allowing time for reflection and observation between sessions.</p>

    <h3>Pre-work</h3>
    <p>Brief reflective exercises to surface your current leadership challenges and context before the first session.</p>

    <h3>Session 1: Framework and Foundation</h3>
    <p>This session introduces the four-quadrant framework and begins the work of mapping your leadership landscape. You’ll learn how leading, directing, managing, and coaching intersect to create the full scope of leadership work, with purpose at the center.</p>

    <p>Through guided solo work and small group reflections, you’ll articulate your purpose—what grounds your leadership practice—and your vision for the direction and impact you’re working toward. You’ll then identify the key outcomes you’re driving, the major processes you work with, and the people you lead or influence.</p>

    <p>This deep work on purpose and vision establishes the foundation for understanding how all your leadership activities connect to what matters most. You’ll leave Session 1 with the core elements of your leadership landscape mapped and ready to build on in the second session.</p>

    <h3>Session 2: Clarity and Application</h3>
    <p>Building on your mapped landscape from Session 1, this session focuses on seeing where your time and energy actually go. You’ll map your current activities across the four quadrants—how you share vision with people, connect vision to outcomes, structure work, and develop capacity—to reveal patterns in your leadership practice.</p>

    <p>Through reflection and small group work, you’ll assess your current leadership patterns: the distribution of your effort across the four modes. You’ll identify gaps, recognize who you’re reaching and who you’re not, and understand what’s present versus what’s missing in your leadership.</p>

    <p>The session closes with clarity on what needs to shift. You’ll leave understanding the full scope of your role and how to make conscious choices about where to focus your leadership going forward.</p>

    <h3>Learning Plan</h3>
    <p>Identify your go-to mode, recognize where you want to expand your range, and create specific practices to continue developing your leadership fluency in daily work.</p>

    <h3>30 Day Check-in</h3>
    <p>A follow-up session to reflect on what you’ve noticed, what’s shifted in your leadership, and how to continue building your range. Share insights with the cohort and troubleshoot challenges.</p>

    <h2>For Teams and Companies</h2>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p><strong>Leadership Fluency can be run in-house for leadership teams, providing both individual clarity and collective insight into your team’s leadership patterns.</strong></p>

    <p>Each person gains clarity on their own leadership landscape—where their time goes, what’s present and missing in their practice, and how they want to lead. At the same time, when a team goes through this together, you see how leadership effort is distributed across the entire team—where you’re collectively over-indexed and where gaps exist that no one is covering. This reveals systemic patterns that are invisible when looking at individual leadership practices alone.</p>

    <p><strong>Teams leave with a shared framework and language for different types of leadership work, allowing them to be more intentional about how they lead and shape work.</strong></p>

    <p>The in-house version can be customized for your organizational context—using your actual challenges, structures, and dynamics as the material for mapping and reflection.</p>
