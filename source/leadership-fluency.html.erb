    <h2>Why This Workshop?</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>When you step into a leadership role, you take on three distinct areas of responsibility: holding and communicating vision, running the business, and developing talent. Each requires a different type of conversation—leading, managing, or coaching.</p>

    <p>What makes this hard is that in any given moment, you need to sense which conversation the situation calls for. Does this person need you to connect them to purpose and possibility? Do they need clear structure and accountability? Or do they need space to discover their own answer?</p>

    <p>Most leaders default to the conversations that feel most natural to them. The visionary keeps casting vision when people need clear next steps. The process-oriented leader creates structure when people need inspiration. The naturally coaching leader asks questions when someone just needs a decision.</p>

    <p>Leadership fluency develops through practice and reflection. This workshop creates space to experience the distinctions between leading, managing, and coaching conversations, map your current challenges through each lens, and build awareness of your patterns and possibilities. You’ll leave with expanded range and the ability to consciously choose your response rather than default to habit.</p>

    <h2>Who this is for</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>This workshop is designed for leaders who already have a foundation in leading, managing, and coaching—and are ready to develop greater fluency in moving between them.</p>

    <p>You’ve been in a leadership role long enough to know your strengths and recognize your go-to mode. Maybe you’re a director navigating increasing complexity, a senior manager building your range, or an executive refining how you show up. You understand the concepts of vision, process, and development. What you're building now is the capacity to sense what each situation needs and respond with intention.</p>

    <p>This workshop serves leaders who:</p>

    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Have responsibility for teams, projects, or functions (at any level)</li>
      <li>Can recognize which type of conversation feels most natural to them</li>
      <li>Want to expand their range beyond their go-to mode</li>
      <li>Are navigating situations that require flexibility in how they show up</li>
      <li>Value experiential learning and are willing to work with their real challenges</li>
    </ul>

      <p>Whether you’re newer to leadership with a solid foundation or a seasoned executive deepening your craft, this work meets you where you are and helps you expand what’s possible.</p>

    <h2>What you can expect</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">

    <p>This workshop combines experiential learning with conceptual frameworks. You’ll work with case studies, practice with different scenarios, and apply the learning to your own real leadership challenges—building familiarity with leading, managing, and coaching through direct experience.</p>

    <p>The workshop covers:</p>

    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>The three fundamental types of conversations in leadership and how to recognize what each situation needs</li>
      <li>How to map complex challenges through multiple lenses to see what you might be missing</li>
      <li>Developing your capacity to sense what's needed rather than reverting to your go-to mode</li>
      <li>The somatic dimension of leadership—how different roles show up in your body and behavior</li>
      <li>Which conversations feel most natural to you and where you want to expand your range</li>
      <li>Practicing all three roles, especially the ones that don't come naturally</li>
      <li>Integration practices to continue building fluency beyond the workshop</li>

    <p>You’ll leave with expanded range, clearer awareness of your go-to mode, and practical experience choosing your response consciously rather than reactively.</p>

    <h2>Approach</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>Leadership Fluency builds capacity through progressive layers of experience and practice, drawing from organizational development, experiential learning, and embodied leadership practices.</p>

    <h3>Experiential Discovery</h3>
    <p>Through direct practice and application, you’ll discover the distinctions between leading, managing, and coaching before conceptualizing them, creating understanding that goes beyond theoretical knowledge.</p>

    <h3>Real Leadership Challenges</h3>
    <p>Through scenarios, case studies, and your own leadership challenges, you’ll work with situations that have immediate relevance to your day-to-day work, practicing different approaches and examining what each reveals. </p>

    <h3>Somatic Intelligence<h3>
    <p>Through body-centered practices, you’ll develop awareness of how different leadership modes show up physically and how your body provides information about what’s needed in each moment.</p>

    <h3>Pattern Recognition</h3>
    <p>Through structured observation and practice, you’ll become aware of your go-to mode—both your strengths and your edges—building the foundation for conscious choice rather than automatic response.</p>

    <h3>Integration Practices</h3>
    <p>Through sustainable practices designed for daily leadership, you’ll continue developing your range beyond the workshop without requiring separate development time.</p>
