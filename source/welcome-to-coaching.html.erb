        <p><strong>Download the Coaching Manual</strong></p>
        <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ANN8-T-UWY08rt0Q8bVjleWNZEzEKt1_/view?usp=copy">The Coaching Manual</a> is designed to help you get a lay of the land, and includes things like links for scheduling our regular sessions and links for spot coaching sessions (also included at the bottom of this page), as well as information about how to get the most out of coaching, additional resources, and a bit about my coaching approach. </p>

        <p><strong>Schedule Your Intake Session</strong></p>
        <p>This is a 90 minute session where we’ll focus on you - who you are today, what you long for in our work together, how the world is different in one year. This information will be used to draft the first version of the Purpose Statement and Outcomes. <a href="https://calendly.com/methodandmatter/coaching-intake">You can use this link to schedule.</a></p>

        <p><strong>Answer the Discovery Questions</strong>
        <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16R0OPS1AjkG8iN3FqaHugdkyMbzyfteVMW4F29U23Fw/edit?usp=sharing">These are a set of questions</a> to get you thinking about what you want from coaching and for me to understand what is important to you and what outcomes you are aiming for. While we’ll go through a lot of this in conversation, people find that taking some time to reflect on their own is helpful. Make a copy of the file and try to share it with me no later than 48 hours before our intake call. </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Take the Enneagram Assessment</strong></p>
        <p>The Enneagram is a dynamic system that helps us understand who we are on a deeper level. The person who introduced it to me described it as a “map to your liberation.” Said another way, the Enneagram doesn’t tell you who you are, but who you mistake yourself to be. I find it a very useful tool at the beginning of coaching engagements because it can help quickly identify limiting patterns and conditioned tendencies that may be getting in the way of you achieving everything you want.</p>

        <p>I partner with an Enneagram expert for this assessment to ensure we land on your type (and I’ll explain more about what that means when we meet). Full disclosure: my <a href="https://www.withinsight.coach/about-me">Enneagram partner</a> is also my partner in life. While he supports the Enneagram typing aspect of our engagement, he will never have access to anything that we talk about or any aspect of our work together. I take confidentiality VERY seriously. If this is not okay with you for any reason, just let me know and we’ll find another approach to working with the Enneagram.</p>

        <p>If you are okay with the above, here are your instructions to proceed with the Enneagram:</p>

        <p><a href="https://enneagramprofiling.com/claim/test">Use this link to take your Chestnut Paes Enneagram test.</a> Use the unique code included in your welcome email to access the test.</p>

        <p>This assessment takes between 20 - 40 minutes to complete, but take as much time as you need. Please do this in one sitting. The questionnaire relates to what you do, think and feel in your everyday life. It does not measure competency or skill and the results are based on formulas to determine your core Enneagram type. Please try and complete this at least 48 hours before we meet.</p>

        <p>Tips for answering the questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Please answer the questions in the context of your life in general and try not to confine your answers to your work environment only.</li>
          <li>Please read the on-page prompts carefully</li>
          <li>Be honest with yourself and answer truthfully – there are no right or wrong answers and no one but you will see the answers you give or have access to your Enneagram results</li>
          <li>Trust your ‘gut’ response to each question as this is usually the most accurate answer</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The results get sent to me and I will then forward them to you with some additional instructions on how to read through your results in advance of our intake session. The testing company does not share any of your data and is full compliance with the European Union’s privacy policies.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Set Up Invoice Logistics</strong></p>
        <p>I’ll need to know the frequency of billing as well as the details of who I should send the invoice to - name, email, address, etc. </p>
