    <h3>A Foundation of Presence</h3>

    <p>Transformation emerges from radical presence. This truth guides how I structure my days and engage with others. Each moment holds the possibility for deep connection and discovery, but only if we create the conditions for presence to flourish.</p>

    <h3>Time and Energy</h3>

    <p>Based in San Francisco, I arrange my days to honor the depth each engagement requires. This means dedicated days for deep work, a maximum of three client sessions per day, and deliberate space between commitments. My practices of meditation, movement, and time in nature create the foundation that enables full presence in every interaction.</p>

    <h3>Reaching Out</h3>

    <p>Initial contact happens through my <%= link_to('inquiry form', 'conversation' ) %>. This helps me understand your needs and respond appropriately. For coaching inquiries, I respond within 48 hours. For other types of inquiries, my response time varies with current commitments.</p>

    <p>Fellow practitioners, researchers, and curious minds interested in collaboration or discussion can also connect with me on <%= link_to('LinkedIn', 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/mignolo/' ) %>—please include a note that helps me understand the context for connecting</p>

    <h3>Communication Rhythms</h3>

    <p>Current clients receive responses and session notes within 48 hours, with additional support available via text and WhatsApp.</p>

    <p>I check email two times a day—in the morning and in the late afternoon—in order to protect my time and energy, and to maintain the presence and attention my work requires.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your patience with response times. This structure enables me to show up fully for the work that matters most.</p>
