    <h3>A Foundation of Presence</h3>

    <p>My work as a coach is to create space for you to slow down and bring more of your experience into awareness. The foundation of this work is trust and connection, for you to feel held in a safe and non-judgemental relationship, allowing whatever you discover to be welcomed. I don’t have the answers—I’m not you nor have I walked your path—but I do know a lot about leadership, organizations, humans, and how we can block ourselves from what we most desire. I also have questions, questions that serve to challenge, support, and open you. I am a gifted listener and intuitive, sensing currents beyond the words you use to uncover deeper layers of who you uniquely are as a leader. The work we do together is custom tailored to you—I do not work with one-size-fits-all approaches to coaching.</p>

    <h3>What Sessions Look Like</h3>

    <p>In coaching sessions, you bring the agenda. It is not up to me to choose what we work on or where we are going—my work is to support <em>you</em> and the challenges and opportunities in front of you. I find that a lot of times people know more than they realize, and through the coaching relationship start to more consistently tap into that knowing. Even if you show up to a session and tell me, “I’m not sure what I want to focus on today,” (which happens frequently enough), within a few minutes of slowing down and getting quiet, something always bubbles up that wants attention.</p>

    <h3>My Approach</h3>
    <p>The challenges you face at work are portals of self transformation, a perfect place to surface the automatic behaviors that have been running the show. These conditioned tendencies live in the mind, the heart, and body—reflected in the thought loops that run through your head, the emotions that carry you into reactivity, and the tensions you hold in your muscles and fascia.</p>

    <p>What this means is that coaching work doesn’t just focus on <em>thinking</em> but also coming into a better relationship with your emotions and working with your body as a instrument of practice. Experiential learning is a core part of my process, which means we’ll try things out together in session, which you can then take forward into your work.</p>

    <h3>Availability</h3>

    <p>All meetings are scheduled with advanced notice. I do most of my scheduling through Calendly. Sessions may be canceled or rescheduled with at least 48 hours notice. Sessions canceled or rescheduled within 48 hours will be counted as complete.</p>

    <p>I work with clients Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday from 11am - 6pm, either on Zoom or a phone call. For clients based in Europe and Africa, alternate time slots are available.</p>

    <h3>Timing and Cadence</h3>
    <p>I see most clients on a bi-weekly cadence for 60 minutes. Folks I've been working with for a while, where we have established a strong relationship of trust and a foundation of work together, may choose to meet ever three or four weeks. And sometimes, when the need is more urgent, I work with folks on a weekly basis.</p>
