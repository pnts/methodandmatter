    <h2>How It Works</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>Your team has been running hard and there is no doubt a lot of work is happening, but underneath the productivity something feels off. The important conversations—the ones about what’s actually slowing you down, what matters, where you’re headed together—aren’t happening. Everyone is tired and reactive. </p>

    <p>You know your team needs space to step back and reconnect, to work on the how of working together, not just the what. You want an offsite that's tailored to your team's reality—one that creates space for what's actually needed, facilitates the conversations that matter, and helps you build genuine capacity for working together in new ways.</p>

    <p>A few common approaches to offsites I've seen:</p>

    <ul class="bullets">
      <li><strong>Generic team-building activities that feel disconnected from the real work.</strong> Trust falls, escape rooms, ropes courses that are "fun" but don't address actual team dynamics. Everyone goes through the motions, maybe laughs, then returns to the same patterns on Monday.</li>
      <li><strong>Strategic planning sessions that produce documents no one remembers.</strong> Two days of PowerPoint presentations about vision, mission, and goals, covered in sticky notes that get photographed and filed away. The plans feel good in the moment but have no grounding in how the team actually functions, so the “strategy” becomes a deck that sits in someone’s drive, disconnected from daily reality.</li>
      <li><strong>Outside consultants who talk at the team instead of with them.</strong> Expert-driven sessions where someone tells the team what they should do, with frameworks and models imposed from the outside that don't fit the team's context. The team feels lectured to rather than engaged with, and there's no space for the team's own wisdom or experience to emerge.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The challenge with these approaches is that they keep people in their heads analyzing everything, and often avoid the real work that needs to get done. They fill everyone with information, but don't do much to impact the real interactions and patterns that get in the way of the team's fullest potential.</p>

    <p><strong>Teams need time to actually slow down and think together—not in the margins of a Tuesday meeting, but dedicated space where they can step back from the daily grind and see the bigger picture.</strong> They also need permission to get real: to name what's actually going on, surface the tensions that usually stay buried, and work with what matters instead of dancing around it.</p>

    <p>This can't happen through lectures or generic exercises—it requires experiential work that engages people fully, gets them out of their heads and into their bodies, and creates the conditions for discovery rather than telling people what they should think.</p>

    <p>Through structured exploration, shared inquiry, and embodied practices, your team creates new understanding, builds capacity for working together differently, and reconnects with why the work matters. The offsite becomes a catalyst—not just for insights that fade by Monday, but for expanding your team's ability to navigate complexity, respond to change, and show up as the connected, aligned team you're capable of being.</p>

    <h2>Why work with me?</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>I've been where you are. I spent over a decade in executive leadership—building and scaling teams, navigating organizational complexity, making hard decisions. I know what it’s like to lead through chaos, to feel the weight of keeping a team aligned and moving forward, to wonder if you’re doing it right. That firsthand experience means I don’t just understand team dynamics theoretically—I’ve lived them. I know what actually works in the messy reality of organizational life, not just in a workshop setting.</p>

    <p>But I also bring rigorous training in the methodologies that create lasting change. I'm a Professional Certified Coach with the International Coaching Federation, trained in Integral Coaching, Gestalt Psychology, Embodied Leadership, and specialized approaches like Appreciative Inquiry and the Enneagram.</p>

    <p>I understand how systems work, how people work, and how to facilitate the kind of experiential learning that builds real capacity. More importantly, I know how to hold space for what wants to emerge rather than imposing solutions from outside. I trust teams to discover their own answers—my role is to create the conditions where that discovery can happen. This combination of lived leadership experience and deep facilitation expertise means I can meet your team exactly where they are and help you get where you want to go.</p>

    <h2>Price & Billing</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>The investment for an offsite varies quite a bit depending on focus, complexity, size of the team, and duration of the offsite. That being said, a common range is between $6,000 - $25,000 USD.</p>

    <p>Reduced rates are available for folks in non-profits and government services.</p>

    <p>While credit cards can be accomodated, ACH is much preferred.</p>
