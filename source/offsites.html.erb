    <h2>How It Works</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>Your team has been running hard and there is no doubt a lot of work is happening, but underneath the productivity something feels off. The important conversations—the ones about what’s actually slowing you down, what matters, where you’re headed together—aren’t happening. Everyone is tired and reactive. </p>

    <p>You know your team needs space to step back and reconnect, to work on the how of working together, not just the what. You want an offsite that's tailored to your team's reality—one that creates space for what's actually needed, facilitates the conversations that matter, and helps you build genuine capacity for working together in new ways.</p>

    <p>In the past you may have tried:</p>

    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Generic team-building activities that feel disconnected from the real work Trust falls, escape rooms, ropes courses that are "fun" but don't address actual team dynamics. Everyone goes through the motions, maybe laughs, then returns to the same patterns on Monday.</li>
      <li>Strategic planning sessions that produce documents no one remembers Two days of PowerPoint presentations about vision, mission, and goals, covered in sticky notes that get photographed and filed away. The plans feel good in the moment but have no grounding in how the team actually functions, so the "strategy" becomes a deck that sits in someone's drive, disconnected from daily reality.</li>
      <li>Outside consultants who talk at the team instead of with them Expert-driven sessions where someone tells the team what they should do, with frameworks and models imposed from the outside that don't fit the team's context. The team feels lectured to rather than engaged with, and there's no space for the team's own wisdom or experience to emerge.</li>
      <li>Personality assessments that create labels without creating change Taking a DiSC or Myers-Briggs assessment and sharing results, learning about each other's "types" but not shifting how the team actually works together. The insights are intellectually interesting but don't translate into new behaviors or capacity—people leave with new language to describe themselves but no real transformation.</li>
      <li>Activities focused on individual development, not team capacity Everyone gets something out of it personally, but the team system doesn't shift. Individual growth doesn't translate into how the team functions together, missing the systems view—working on people instead of working with the team as a whole.</li>
      <li>Offsites designed around the leader's agenda, not the team's needs The leader has a specific outcome in mind and designs the offsite to get there, so team members show up but aren't truly engaged because it's not addressing what they need. It lacks genuine discovery or emergence, feels predetermined, and the team can sense they're being managed toward a conclusion.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The challenge with these approaches is that they keep people in their head (strategic planning, personality assessments, expert lectures) or avoid the real work (surface-level activities, fun distractions). They don't help the team see itself as a system, don't create space for genuine discovery, and don't build the capacity for teams to work together differently. The offsite becomes something that happens to the team rather than something the team experiences and integrates together.</p>

    <h2>Price & Billing</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>The investment for an offsite varies quite a bit depending on focus, complexity, size of the team, and duration of the offsite. That being said, a common range is between $6 - $25,000 USD.</p>

    <p>Reduced rates are available for folks in non-profits and government services.</p>

    <p>While credit cards can be accomodated, ACH is much preferred.</p>
