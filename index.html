    <h2>You don't have to go it alone.</h2>
    <p class="lead">Your leadership journey is unique, but it doesn't have to be lonely. If you are feeling stuck, challenged, or uncertain, working with a coach - a trusted partner and loyal ally - can open up new worlds of possibility, impact, and effectiveness.</p>

    <p>Working at the intersection of business, design, leadership and people, I combine integral coaching with appreciative inquiry, design thinking, organziational design, and business strategy to help leaders flourish. </p>

    <h3>What is method + matter?</h3>
    <p>method + matter is a coaching company started by <a href="https://pnts.us">Andrea Mignolo</a> that combines design, coaching, business, and leadership to facilitate the development of more resilient, compassionate, and present leaders.</p>

    <h3>Why method + matter?</h3>
    <p>I am passionate about working with people who are committed to creative ways of leading (and living) in this volatile and uncertain world. People who know there are better ways, who are bravely leading in the face of adversity, whose unique leadership archetype is desperately needed in this world. People who are determined to build a better future, who have hope, who refuse to give up. People who sense that their own transformation is the key to unlocking their wildest dreams, their teams, their companies, and their world.</p>

    <p>I believe that personal transformation is the foundation for meaningful change. By starting with ourselves we can examine ingrained patterns of communicating, responding, and collaborating. As we start to understand and shift our patterns we experience new possibilities for how we show up, and in these possibilities are the seeds of larger change.</p>

    <h3>My background</h3>
    <p>Combining <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mignolo/">10 years of design leadership experience</a> with formal training in business and coaching, I help individuals and teams design the structures, processes, and cultures that help them do their best work.</p>

    <h3>Testimonials</h3>
    <blockquote>I had the opportunity to work with Andi over the course of a year that brought a number of significant personal and professional challenges into my life. I consider myself truly fortunate to have had the benefit of Andi's support and guidance during this time. Andi is a truly gifted coach and amazing human being. Her coaching practice brings insights from the many domains she has expertise in, from design and business leadership to holistic psychology to the martial arts. Working with her has enabled me to integrate my mind and body in ways I couldn't have imagined, to face deep-seated fears and contradictions, and to emerge from my struggles as a stronger, kinder, wiser, and more resilient person. I highly recommend working with Andi to anyone who wants to move to the next level in their personal and professional life and is ready to take a leap forward in their journey of self-realization.</blockquote>
    <p class="source">- Dmitry Nekrasovski, Senior Manager, Product Design at Hashicorp</p>

    <blockquote>In my eight months with Andi, she helped me to identify my professional and personal aspirations, to develop practices that vastly improved my mental and emotional health, and to ultimately reconnect with the joy of my being. Her coaching plan was completely tailored to me, and it was always evolving with my own growth. Andi is compassionate, observant, and infinitely wise. I feel so fortunate that I was able to work with her.</blockquote>

    <h3>The method + matter approach</h3>
    <p>My approach is built on a foundation of Integral Coaching. The purpose of this style of coaching is to use a person's entire world as material for developing self-generating, self-sustaining practices that will be relevant through the arc of their career and life. Integral Coaching is not coaching for compliance, or coaching for accountability. It is deeply humanistic work that opens up insights and possibilities for new paths forward.</p>

    <p>Client programs are designed around developmental outcomes, where success is measured by a change in observable behaviors. Over the course of 6 months (12 sessions), I work with people to deepen their understanding of what has them stuck at this point in their lives, and to unwind unhelpful patterns of behavior that act to keep the stuckness in place.</p>

<!--    <h3>What you can expect</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><p>First things first: we start with a chemistry call. Chemsitry calls are a great way for us to get familiar with each other, for me to understand what is coming up for you and what brings you to coaching, and for you to learn more about the integral coaching approach. Ultimately the purpose of this call is to figure out if we are a good fit for each other. It's paramount for you to find a coach that you are comfortable with, and that you trust. This call helps us explore these themes together.</p></li>

      <li><p>If things are copasetic and you'd like to move forward, we'll review the coaching agreement, confidentiality statement, coaching code of ethics, figure out a payment plan, and basically get all the paperwork in place. We'll also schedule our first 3 - 5 sessions.</p></li>

      <li><p>Our first session is a 90 minute intake call where I work integrally to understand where you are at, what is coming up for you, and what is occuring in the various domains of your life. This material is used, in combination with a number of integral models, as the basis of your coaching program.</p>

      <li><p>In the second session I'll deliver your coaching program, complete with a purpose statement and developmental outcomes aligned with your context and goals. We'll also review exercises, practices, reading, and resources that will start you on your path to personal and professional transformation.</p></li>

      <li><p>Sessions 3 - 11 will take, as a point of departure, whatever is coming up for you in the moment we sit down together. We'll check in on execises and practices, review how you are progressing towards your developmental outcomes, and deepen our work in areas of resistence and in shifting old patterns of behavior.</p></li>

      <li><p>In session 12 we'll review the work and progress that have occurred over the last 6 months, and discuss if there is anything left to do. We'll define a path forward that incorporates </p></li> -->

    <p>Coaching is a co-creative process, but structurally a typical program includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A 90 minute intake session where I work to understand where you are at, what is coming up for you, and what your understanding of your current situation is</li>
        <li>12 individual coaching sessions over the course of 6 months</li>
        <li>A personalized coaching program designed with developmental outcomes for your context and goals</li>
        <li>Tailored practices to support new ways of leading, working, and showing up in the world</li>
        <li>Resources for continued learning and development</li>
        <li>Recordings of each session and follow-up notes</li>
        <li>Email and text support in between sessions (I'm here for you!)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>While it is understood that we are all busy with careers, family, friends, hobbies, and life as it generally unfolds, this type of work does require committment and time set aside each day to engage in practices, reflections, and exercises to facilitate the work of transformation and change. Depending on the person, this can be anywhere from 15 minutes a day to an hour or more. Don't panic! I can work with what you have going on to find a suitable program that works for you.</p>
