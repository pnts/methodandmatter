  <h1>Shaping leadership and life.</h1>
  <h2>Increase the coherence between vocation and values, embody presence in the midst of uncertainty, and take creative, choiceful action. </h2>

  <div class="explainer">

  <p>Sometimes it can feel like everything has gone out of alignment. That inexplicably, and maybe quite suddenly, what worked before is no longer working. When this happens we have two options - ignore it and keep pushing forward as usual, or listen and evolve.</p>

  <p>method & matter is a <strong>resource for leaders and seekers</strong> who feel called to alchemize these unique moments, <strong>transforming what no longer serves into fuel for deep and lasting change.</strong> </p>
