    <h2>What It Is</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>Integration sessions are for individuals who have experienced a change in their relationship to work—usually through peak experiences, expanded states of consciousness, the resurfacing of forgotten memories, or some kind of shift in identity—and want support making sense of what is happening.</p>

    <p>When hidden parts of you start to make their way into conscious awareness, whatever the cuase, it can feel disruptive and unsettling. You might feel called to something deeper, experience a loss of meaning, question everything in your world, and/or feel completely disoriented.</p>

    <p>The good news is nothing is wrong with you! This is a natural part of how we grow and mature as humans, and we are all born with the capacity to step into greater wholeness. But over time, most of us have forgotten how.</p>

    <p>Integration sessions re-connect you with your own unique process of living and leading. They are a supportive and gentle way for folks to work with new understandings of leadership and life that challenge the status quo.</p>

  <div class="col-1">
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>You can think of integration sessions as a kind of co-meditation—together we settle into a state of presence and listen to what most wants attention. We work experientially by noticing and welcoming whatever shows up, free of self-judgement and blame. </p>

    <p>Through gentle attunement, somatic inquiry, and visualization you begin to metabolize what was hidden and open into deeper wholeness. With my support you'll design practices that can weave the new learnings, insights, and openings into your everyday life.</p>

    <p>Integration sessions run for 50 minutes and are scheduled on an as-needed basis. Afterwards I'll send you a recording of the session and any additional resources as needed.</p>

    <h2>Who Its For</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>Integration sessions are not therapy—they are not designed to address pscyhological problems but rather support ontological wholness. Which is to say, integration sessions work at the level of <em>being.</em></p>

    <p>For leaders looking to work with metaphysical, spiritual, and philosophical conceptions dealing with meaning, purpose, and the nature of work, integration sessions are a good match.</p>

    <p>If you are noticing strong emotions showing up in particular situations at work, old memories that keep resurfacing, and/or persistent tension in the body, integration sessions could be a good fit.</p>

    <p>And if you would like additional support integrating insights from dreams, psychedelic experiences, and non-ordinary states of consciousness, integration sessions are for you.</p>
