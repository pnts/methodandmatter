    <h2>Why This Course?</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <blockquote><p>This has been one of the most valuable courses I've taken for leadership & management&mdash;it unlocked a lot of realizations for myself and how I interact with people both professionally and personally to help me become a much better leader with coaching ability going forward! <span class="blockquote-right">&mdash; Director of Operations</span></p> </blockquote>

    <p>There are small signals that let a leader know it is time for a shift: feedback conversations that keep getting pushed back, burnout from trying to solve everyone’s problems, and team members consistently seeking answers rather than discovering their own.</p>

    <p>
      Successful leaders often recognize when they're ready for this evolution: when calendars filled with meetings leave little space for meaningful development conversations, when talented team members consistently seek answers rather than developing their own, and when constant problem-solving leaves them energetically depleted. These moments signal an opportunity to expand their leadership approach.</p>

    <p>Leader as Coach is a seven-week journey that transforms how you show up for your team. Through experiential learning, you'll develop:</p>

    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>The ability to transform difficult conversations into opportunities for connection and growth</li>
      <li>Skills to help team members discover their own solutions, reducing your problem-solving burden</li>
      <li>A sustainable leadership practice that energizes rather than depletes</li>
      <li>Communication approaches that build trust through honesty and transparency</li>
      <li>Discernment to know when coaching serves best and when direction is needed</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In a small cohort of peers facing similar challenges, you'll learn foundational coaching skills, practice real-world conversations, and develop approaches authentic to your leadership style. Past participants report not just enhanced leadership effectiveness, but a fundamental shift in how leadership feels: more energizing, less draining, and ultimately more impactful.</p>

    <p>If you're ready to transform difficult conversations into meaningful ones, develop your team's potential, and lead with both impact and sustainability, Leader as Coach is your next step.</p>

  <div class="col-2">
    <h3>Week 1 - The Foundations of Coaching</h3>
    <p>To have effective and impactful coaching conversations, leaders must first make a shift in their mindset and approach.

    <h3>Week 2 - Making Observations and Working with Emotions</h3>
    <p>Learn how to make grounded observations based on data to facilitate increased awareness in a learning conversation. And learn what emotions are and how to work with them in organizational settings to build trust and create psychological safety.</p>

    <h3>Week 3 - Listening and Asking Questions</h3>
    <p>The ability to utilize several forms of listening combined with an understanding of the anatomy of powerful questions gives coaches the ability to facilitate change in others. By the end of this lesson students will have experience with different levels of listening and proficiency with asking open and honest questions in service of creating space for others to think.</p>

    <h3>Week 4 - The Coaching Conversation I</h3>

    <h3>Week 7 - Integration</h3>
    <p>In our final session we bring everything together from the past five weeks.
