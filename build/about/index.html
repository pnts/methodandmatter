    <h1>Hi, I'm Andrea.</h1>
    <p class="nickname">You can call me Andi.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <img src="/images/andi-snake.png" class="bio" alt="" />

    <p>I am the daughter of Anne Wylie and Walter Mignolo, and the granddaughter of Elizabeth, Andrew, Nieves, and Domingo. I am a descendent of ancestors who once lived in Hungary, Italy, Scotland, Ireland, and Germany and am a citizen of the United States and Argentina.</p>

    <p>Since 2021 I've worked with hundreds of leaders to develop aligned, meaningful, and sustainable ways of leading and working. I've walked the path myself for more than a decade in leadership positions, going from a first time exec who tried to emulate the leadership styles around me (massive failure!) to a seasoned leader showing up with integrity, care, and joyful (sometimes mischievous) creativity—qualities that are authnically me. This journey has taught me that it is possible to center human dignity while embracing difficult conversations, making tough decisions, and leading through challenging times. And that we each bring our own flavor to how we show up for ourselves, for our work, and for others.</p>

    <p>In addition to hands-on experience, I have an MBA from the <a href="https://case.edu/weatherhead/">Weatherhead School of Management</a> with a focus on leadership and organizational design, am a Professional Certified Coach with the <a href="https://coachingfederation.org">International Coaching Federation</a>, and have trained in several coaching modalities including <a href="https://newventureswest.com">Integral Coaching</a>, <a href="https://gisc.org">Gestalt Coaching</a>, and <a href="https://strozziinstitute.org">Embodied Leadership</a>. I am a <a href="htts://irest.org">Level 1 iRest Teacher</a> and am also fully certified to teach the <a href="https://realizationprocess.org">Realization Process</a>, a gentle and embodied approach to non-duality. I've also spent five years (and counting) working with entheogenic allies.</p>

    <p>I come to this work in service of supporting leaders to release the ways they’ve hidden themselves and recognize that leadership is exactly the right place to share their unique and special gifts. I do this because I know first-hand how toxic and exhausting organizational life can be. And as the systems we live in become more shaky, punctured regularly by events that turn individuals, communities, cities, and even countries upside down, and it can be damn hard to show up at work and feel like anything we do matters, let alone lead authentically.</p>

    <p>The key is to flip this on its head. Authentic leadership is essential in these times because it reminds us of what matters most. We start by remembering our values and committments, and from there move out into the world, rather than let the events of the world consume us. We start with where we are, and who we are, and from this place take the next step. Through presence, wholeness, and connection, authentic leaders see what others miss, take right action, and build networks of care in service of healthy teams and business results.</p>

    <p>Outside of coaching I am a baker, back country camper, and a budding martial artist in the lineage of Choy Li Fut Kung Fu, Qi Gong, and Tai Chi.</p>
