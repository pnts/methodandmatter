<p>Happy final day of Gregory‚Äôs calendar!</p>

<p>If you are the kind of person that likes to reflect at specific times of the year, <a href="https://methodandmatter.com/writing/guides/end-of-a-cycle/">At the End of a Cycle</a> might be right up your ally. It‚Äôs my personal method of taking stock, though these days I often skip the first two sections and go straight to the letter writing. I <em>love</em> letter writing! Which you could do as well‚Äîthe guide isn‚Äôt meant to be prescriptive but supportive, suggestive, and most importantly <em>fun</em>.</p>

<p>Here in San Francisco the last few weeks have been unexpectedly fruitful. Not through any volition on my end, the days just seem to have agendas of their own. The day god and the place god, doing their thing.</p>

<p>It's nice when things finally come together. When long pockets of confusion clear and you realize the path was there all along. I especially like it because it takes me a rather long time to get my mind around something, let alone express it. During which there is a lot of self-doubt, grimacing, floundering, and shrugging of shoulders. And jokes, lots of jokes.</p>

<p>Confusion for me feels like a tumble of sensations, thoughts, and images that feel individually resonant but simultaneously isolated, like the lone house at the end of a cul-de-sac. And these isolated things have to jumble around and knock into each other a billion times before, click! The knowing happens.</p>

<p>Some what's been jumbling around: consciousness, emergence, somatics, time, ecology, poetry, divinity, language, mysticism, dreams, non-dual stuff, imaginal practices, and relationality.</p>

<hr />

<p>At the turn of the century I lived in New Orleans for a spell, an old fancy house in the Garden District. In the wee hours of Mardi Gras morning I woke to an otherwordly tune, ostensibly coming from one of the early krewes making their way to the French Quarter. But when I looked out my window there was nothing. No bands, no floats, just empty streets. Nothing that might reveal the identity of these mysterious musicians. I think that was the first time I really <em>listened.</em> Not with my ears, but my entire being. Present, open, and luminous. Woven directly into the fabric of reality, dense and transparent, receiving and participating.</p>

<hr />

<p>These things that are jumbling around, each comes to me like my mystery Mardi Gras song. A quick catch of the breath, a punctuated moment of focus, just enough to say hey, pay extra attention here. And I do, for as long as I can, until everything goes back to jumbling around. This happens with books, teachers, music, images, offerings, recipes, poems, and dreams (to name a few). Each appearing at just the right time with a whisper of affirmation, enough to push things a little farther, and then back to the jumble.</p>

<p>When I was home visiting my folks for Thanksgiving in November, I told Papa Mignolo that I wanted to work on a dissertation, but without enrolling in a PhD program. I want to do deep work, but from what I can tell I am not cut out for academic writing, my research interests are heavy on praxis,  and I don‚Äôt want to become a professor. So why not craft a research practice outside the hallowed halls of institutional life?</p>

<p>Ever the professor, he asked me for my research statement. üôÉ</p>

<hr />

<p>A few days ago I spent an entire morning organizing a giant folder (four years worth) of PDFs. Which, until recently, had been living in my downloads folder in reverse-chronological order. I knew the work would be mindless, but it also felt important, so I made a cup of coffee and surrendered to the task. About halfway through, <em>everything</em> started coming together. All those things jumbling around came together like Voltron. By the end of the day, I sent my dad a research statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My research explores listening as an embodied practice of attunement through which humans might rediscover our place within the living world. Following Gebser's analysis of perspectival consciousness as a force of ‚Äúdeworlding,‚Äù I investigate how deep listening practices‚Äîsupported through somatic awareness, dialogue, and careful work with psychedelics‚Äîmight contribute to the emergence of aperspectival consciousness. This work examines how humans, through sustained attention to local ecologies, dreamworlds, relationality, and fundamental consciousness, can become transversal intensifiers of sympoietic arrangements. The aim is not simply to engage with the more-than-human world, but to participate in a fundamental reworlding that transforms human consciousness and our mode of belonging within Earth's living systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It‚Äôs not perfect, but it captures the light in my heart and gets me excited to do the work I do each day. And I‚Äôm sharing this here because <em>this is the becoming</em>. Which I had been gesturing towards all along but hadn‚Äôt quite figured out. Until now. I'm still crafting what this non-institutional dissertation-ish thing looks like, which I'll share when I have more clarity.</p>

<hr />

<p>I also updated the newsletter‚Äôs landing page to provide more background, which I‚Äôd like to share here:</p>

<p>In the 13th century, a technological revolution began.</p>

<p>The introduction of Arabic numerals into Europe unleashed the power of abstract thought. Early innovations, like the codification of double-entry bookkeeping, enabled mathematical techniques for finance and commerce to go mainstream. Along with other tools like the compass, musical notation, and map-making, the ability to represent, model, manipulate, and control the world around us became not only possible, but amplified.</p>

<p>The practical knowledge obtained through abstract representation allowed science and engineering to flourish, and also buffered humans from the direct impact of their actions through the mediating feedback loops of technology. After 800 years of assumed authority over the order of things, we have forgotten what it means to be direct participants in a living world, alongside our more-than-human kin.</p>

<p>Jean Gebser calls the structure of consciousness that emerged alongside abstract representation, the perspectival or mental structure, as seen in the wide spread adoption of the geometrical perspective in art. As Cynthia Bourgeault writes, ‚Äú[t]he same growing capacity for abstraction that makes possible the perception of proportion and depth also‚Äîby the same measure‚Äîincreases our sense of separation. We stand more on the outside, our attention fixed on that hypothetical point on the horizon which organizes our canvas and maintains the illusion of depth within a flat plane.‚Äù</p>

<p>Completely separated from the systems that support us, the mental structure of consciousness is deficient and decaying. The possiblity of a new structure is now emerging but not promised‚Äîthat of the aperspectival or integral. For Gebser, structures of consciousness are not developmental, but phenomenological, experienced by what he describes as ‚Äúwakeful presence‚Äù. The aperspectival, containing all previous structures (mental, mythic, magic, archaic), becomes an intensified wakeful and participatory presence, liberating consciousness from the confines of perspectival worlding.</p>

<p>We cannot utilize the tools of perspectival consciousness to model or manipulate our way into the aperspectival structure. Instead, we must learn to attune differently‚Äînot as separate observers studying an object, but as embodied participants in a living world that is already speaking. This newsletter explores practices of attunement that might help us recover our capacity for direct participation in the multi-species salon of ever-present becoming. Through sharing research-in-progress, field notes, practices, and emerging insights, I hope to contribute to conversations about how we might move beyond the limitations of perspectival consciousness and into new ways of becoming-with our more-than-human kin.</p>
