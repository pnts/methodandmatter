          <![CDATA[
            <p>Picture a time when someone physically grabbed you. Not necessarily in a threatening way, though these types of grabs happen too. Maybe a friend pulled you back from walking into a busy street or a colleague was trying get your attention as you walked by at a conference.</p>

<p>Do you remember what happened? How your body responded before you had a chance to think? You were probably activated in some habitual way—muscles tense, cortisol released, a little bit of a recoil as you automatically assessed the threat level.</p>

<p>Even if the person who grabbed you did it in a “friendly” way, it demanded your attention, your nervous system shifting into protective mode. You probably weren’t aware of anything else in that moment, and afterwards it might have taken you some time to return to equilibrium.</p>

<h3 id="daily-grabs">Daily Grabs</h3>

<p>Now imagine being grabbed a hundred times a day, because that's what happens! Not physically, but mentally and emotionally. Work place conflicts, news cycles, inner critics, societal expectations, uncertainty—there are so many ways we can be grabbed. And the nervous system doesn't care what the source is, so it will respond in the same way it does to a physical grab.</p>

<p>Let’s say you have an interaction with your boss that feels off. You have the thought that your boss doesn’t like you (which feels really threatening), and your body reacts—you tense up, constrict your breathing, pull away, and try and control your reaction. Which usually creates a negative feedback loop of increasing intensity—nervous system is activated, the physical sensations of discomfort become stronger, and the worry thoughts amp up.</p>

<p>What happens when this negative feedback loop continues for days, weeks, or even months? Where each day at work you are constantly on the lookout for signals of how your boss feels about you, picking apart the smallest details of a comment or obsessively comparing how your boss reacts to others in order to figure out where you stand. In this increased state of vigilance, the smallest thing can knock you over.</p>

<p>If you take this same approach in martial arts, your attacker will easily win. Your reactive state keeps you off balance and up in your head, responding from instinct while trying to “figure out” what to do.</p>

<h3 id="centering">Centering</h3>

<p>The antidote to this is centering. In the physical body, center is about two or three fingers below the belly button, and back a bit, closer to the spine. Try moving your attention there now, from your head to your physical center. Bring your breath all the way down, as if you were breathing from this place in your body. Feel what shifts.</p>

<p>You might notice some tension is released in the neck and shoulders. Or you might feel more of your legs. Maybe your peripheral vision widens, or you feel a little more connected to yourself, more present.</p>

<p>Centering doesn’t keep the grabs from happening, but it helps us see them coming. And when we can see them, we have choice in how we respond. We can choose not to engage, we can blend with the energy and move it another direction, we can block and counter attack—from a centered place the options are plenty.</p>

<p>This applies equally in the boardroom as it does on the mat. Centering helps us be more rooted, open, and responsive. And the more familiar we are with center, the easier it is to come back to it when something pulls us away.</p>

<p>Centering keeps us balanced under pressure. Think of a recent meeting you’ve been in, one that was challenging in some way or another. Your awareness was probably concentrated in your upper body from the shoulders on up. You might have noticed some tension, and that your thoughts were focused on the exchange of words, or on crafting your own verbal response. As the meeting progressed, it might have felt more and more adversarial.</p>

<p>We aren’t balanced when we center in the head. Centering from the body reminds us that interactions don’t just happen with words, but between bodies. When we shift attention to our belly center, physical tension is released, breathing deepens, and the nervous system settles. This changes how we speak, listen, and act, leading to new outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="try-it-out">Try It Out</h3>

<p>Place your hands, one on top of the other, about three fingers below your belly button. Take three slow breaths, imagining each inhale traveling all the way down to fill the space under your lower hand. As you exhale, let your shoulders drop and soften.</p>

<p>Notice what shifts—perhaps your jaw unclenches, your vision widens, or you simply feel more present in your body.</p>

<p>This same practice works beautifully in meetings. When you feel that familiar “grab”—an unexpected question, pushback on your idea, or tension in the room—take a moment to breathe into your center. You don’t need to close your eyes or make it obvious.</p>

<p>Simply shift your attention from your racing thoughts down to that steady place in your belly.</p>

<p>From there, you might find yourself listening more deeply, speaking with more clarity, or discovering a response you couldn’t access when you were centered in your head.</p>

<p>Keep practicing this during the week, especially in calm moments. The more you experience center, the easier it is to come back to it when something tries to grab you.</p>

        <title>Unbundling Leadership</title>

        <description>
          <![CDATA[
            <p>Unbundling is a business strategy that seeks to take things apart with the purpose of creating a more functional or competitive business. GE, under Jack Welch, spun off or sold underperforming business units in order to focus on the most profitable divisions, Craigslist unbundled classified ad revenue from traditional newspapers, and the shift to digital distribution unbundled songs from an album in the form of MP3s.</p>

<p>Leadership strikes me as something else that could benefit from unbundling. Not as a theoretical term, but as the practical application of what happens when someone steps into a formal leadership role. By this I mean a role that, in addition to vision and influence, comes with positional power, responsibility for a team and/or function, and possibly P&amp;L responsibilities.</p>

<p>When you step into a leadership role you’re often expected to get on with the work without much guidance or training. The new responsibilities, relationships, and altitude you need to think at are at best loosely defined in a career matrix, but more commonly have to be inferred from the organizational environment.</p>

<p>Faced with this murkiness, leaders take a number of approaches—mirroring the leaders around them, becoming the type of leader they always wanted but never had, or staying heads down and focusing on the work.</p>

<p>What I wish I had known, when I stepped into my first leadership role, is that leadership is a bundle of three different and somewhat distinct areas of responsibility: holding and communicating the vision, running the business, and developing talent. Each corresponds to a different role: leader, manager, and coach. While in practice the three blend together, it can be helpful to understand the distinct configuration of each.</p>

<h2 id="leader">Leader</h2>
<p>Leadership is the embodiment of vision and values in action. Leaders connect people to purpose, make meaning of challenges, and inspire collective movement towards shared goals. The mindset of a leader is oriented towards the future, possibility, and innovation.</p>

<p>Key responsibilities include creating and communicating the vision, aligning efforts with core values, listening to what is happening in organization, helping people understand the “why”, and showing how individual and team work contributes to larger organizational goals.</p>

<p>Leaders must do this both for the people on the team/function/department they are in charge of, and also for their colleagues across the organization. They are responsible for making sure that the work they are responsible for is understood across the company and <em>why</em> it matters in the first place.</p>

<h3 id="reflection-questions">Reflection questions:</h3>

<h4 id="vision--purpose">Vision &amp; Purpose:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How effectively am I translating abstract vision into concrete, relatable terms for my team?</li>
  <li>What stories am I telling that help people see themselves in our shared future?</li>
  <li>Does our vision still resonates with the team's evolving needs?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="influence--inspiration">Influence &amp; Inspiration:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Am I modeling the behaviors and values I want to see in others?</li>
  <li>How do I respond when my vision meets resistance or skepticism?</li>
  <li>What legacy am I creating through my leadership decisions?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="organizational-impact">Organizational Impact:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How well do I understand the broader ecosystem my team operates within?</li>
  <li>Where might I be inadvertently creating silos or barriers to collaboration?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="manager">Manager</h2>
<p>Management is the practice of running a business—orchestrating work systems and processes to achieve predictable outcomes. The mindset of a manager orients towards operational excellence and structured thinking.</p>

<p>Key responsibilities include setting clear expectations in the form of shared agreements, establishing effective processes, identifying metrics of success, ensuring efficient resource allocation, and maintaining stability and consistency.</p>

<p>It is worthwhile to note that the role of manager and leader can often be at odds. While the role of leader orients towards new possibilities through innovation, the role of manager is focused on healthy and repeatable processes. Leadership can be a destabilizing threat to management predictability.</p>

<h3 id="reflection-questions-1">Reflection Questions:</h3>

<h4 id="systems--processes">Systems &amp; Processes:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>What friction points are slowing down our team’s ability to deliver results?</li>
  <li>How do I balance standardization with the need for flexibility?</li>
  <li>Which meetings, reports, or processes could we eliminate without losing value?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="performance--accountability">Performance &amp; Accountability:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How quickly do I address performance gaps when they arise?</li>
  <li>Am I giving people the tools and resources they need to succeed?</li>
  <li>What would happen if I wasn't here for a week—would things run smoothly?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="resource-optimization">Resource Optimization:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Where am I over-investing or under-investing our team’s time and energy?</li>
  <li>How effectively am I protecting my team from organizational noise and distractions?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="coach">Coach</h2>
<p>Coaching is way of developing talent by supporting people to achieve the results they want through self-awareness and behavior change. The mindset of a coach is one of curiosity and learning, a willingness to let go of knowing the answer and trust that each person has the capacity to figure out their own path forward.</p>

<p>Key responsibilities for the coaching role cover creating space for reflection, asking powerful questions, supporting others to connect with their inner wisdom, and expanding how people observe and understand the situations they find themselves in.</p>

<p>Mentorship also falls under the umbrella of coaching. The way I distinguish between the two is that coaching is designed to connect someone to their own inner knowing with support from the coach in the form of questions and observations, while mentorship is oriented around a more senior person sharing insights from hard-won experience in order to help a more junior person grow.</p>

<h3 id="reflection-questions-2">Reflection Questions:</h3>

<h4 id="development--growth">Development &amp; Growth:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>What assumptions am I making about what each person needs to grow?</li>
  <li>How often do I ask “What do you think?” before offering my own perspective?</li>
  <li>When have I seen someone surprise themselves with their own capability?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="creating-safety">Creating Safety:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How comfortable do people feel bringing me problems or admitting mistakes?</li>
  <li>What signals might I be sending that discourage open dialogue?</li>
  <li>How do I respond when someone's approach differs from what I would do?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="letting-go">Letting Go:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Where am I solving problems that others could solve themselves?</li>
  <li>How do I distinguish between when to step in and when to step back?</li>
  <li>What would it look like to be less helpful in service of others’ growth?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>It is important to note that within each of these roles there is a wide range of variability. How you lead, manage, and coach will be shaped by your experiences, values, and beliefs about how good work gets done (and what qualifies as good work in the first place</p>

<p>Give it a try this week—track each of your days and see where you lead, manage, and coach. You might find one role is more comfortable you or that certain contexts require one role over the others. There is no one right way, but I hope that unbundling these three roles gives you useful insight to be more impactful as a leader.</p>
