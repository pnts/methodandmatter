          <![CDATA[
            <p>Someone recently wrote with a question that felt important to share more broadly:</p>

<p>“How do we develop greater objectivity about ourselves? What I am wondering about is the stories we hold about how others see us, and how those can be totally skewed and completely off. How do we get back to a more normal curve  of folks’ perspectives on us?”</p>

<p>I love this question! And will start with an existential disclaimer that we can never <em>really</em> know how others see us—each person is a contained, complex world of experience, perceptions, ancestry, genetics, narratives, and relations—impossible to ever get the full truth of. As Salman Rushdie so poignantly said, “to understand just one life you have to swallow the world.”</p>

<p>But that isn’t very useful in the context of work, so let’s bring this down to a more practical level. “How others see us” is an essential component of leadership and career development, something people often miss in the earlier stages of professional life. It’s not just our skills and abilities that move us forward, but also being aware of (and influencing) how others see us—our strengths, weaknesses, style, and impact.</p>

<p>Now, the fact that you asked that question means you’ve already taken the first step—you’ve realized that we don’t see the world objectively, but that our perception is always filtered through the lens of stories (as the apocryphal saying goes, “We don’t see things as they are. We see them as we are.”). This is just a feature of being human, stories allow us to create efficiencies about how we understand the world so that we can take action.</p>

<p>But sometimes these stories can be “totally skewed and completely off”. In leadership, and in life, the ability to assess our stories for coherence with the world around us is an important skill. If we act from stories that are skewed, then the choices we make may not serve us as powerfully as we had hoped.</p>

<p>Interestingly, thanks to negativity bias, the stories that are most likely to be skewed are the ones that assume people don’t like us or think poorly of us in some way. From early childhood we are attuned to signals that inform us of any threat to safety and belonging, signals that are largely non-verbal. Facial expressions, body language, energy shifts, withdrawal or aggression—each family system has ways to cultivate “acceptable” behavior, and thus belonging.</p>

<p>That sensitivity comes with us to the workplace, and we unconsciously scan for anything that could challenge our sense of who we are and how we belong. Which means that if someone unknowingly engages in similar cues, ones that are familiar from our upbringing, we might start to experience discomfort, fear, and uncertainty. The difference is that their behavior is almost 100% <em>not</em> driven by the same reasons as it was in your family, but your nervous system doesn’t know that. And suddenly you are in grip of a skewed story.</p>

<p>Without realizing this is happening, most people take the logical next step of trying to see themselves through the other person’s eyes. But when a leader is fused with strong emotions this becomes a futile task. The discomfort of anger or shame has them “leave” themselves to observe from the outside, in an attempt to distance themselves from uncomfortable feelings. The emotion, however, isn’t left behind but comes along and gets added to the story of how others see them. There is no way for the leader to get a normal curve of understanding because they are functioning from within their own emotional constructs, like being trapped in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_mirror">infinity mirror</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-manager-and-maggie">The Manager and Maggie</h3>
<p>I’ve been talking a bit abstractly here, so let’s look at an example of what this looks like in a typical day at the office:</p>

<p>Let’s say you are the head of a team and you are in a 1:1 with a direct report. We’ll call them Maggie. You say something that feels normal and everyday to you and you notice Maggie gets quiet and withdraws. Your mom also had a pattern of withdrawing and this activates in you a subtle fear you did something wrong.</p>

<p>After the 1:1 you begin to wonder if you are a bad manager. Feeling the edges of shame, you disconnect from yourself and try to see through Maggie's eyes. The problem is that when you try to do this while gripped by shame (or another strong emotion), you project your own inner critic onto her—thinking she is judging you, when that harsh voice is actually yours.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, from Maggie’s perspective, you happened to use a phrase that a terrible manager from her past used a lot, and her brain just flashed back to that experience. Maggie’s body was in the meeting, but her mind was ruminating in the past. She was fully hooked into this experience and it wasn’t until after the meeting that she started to come back to present and get on with her day. At which point she felt grateful to be in a place with a much more caring and capable manager.</p>

<p>What happened here? A single phrase whisked Maggie into a visceral experience from the past. And you, her manager, having observed the outward manifestation of Maggie’s “time travel” as withdrawal, experience a sense of alarm and twist yourself up trying to see yourself from her perspective. Which you can’t, because you are standing in your own sense of discomfort or shame about having caused Maggie to withdraw, so you can only see yourself through your own stories that you are misattributing to Maggie.</p>

<p>So what can we do?</p>

<h3 id="stay-connected">Stay Connected</h3>
<p>Trying to see ourselves from someone else’s perspective often requires us to disconnect from our own experience. And when this happens, we are most likely to find ourselves inside an infinity mirror.</p>

<p>So the first step is to stay connected to yourself. To be aware of and feel your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations, without judgement, and let them bring information to you. This includes sensations that don’t feel great, and emotions we typically categorize as “negative” (there is no such thing, by the way!). Doing this without going into story or trying to immediately figure it out will strengthen your ability to observe yourself, others, and what is happening in the larger environment.</p>

<p>Staying connected, in the example with Maggie, would have looked like noticing Maggie suddenly got quiet and seemed to be somewhere else, and when that happened something also started to happen in you. Stay anchored in what is happening in your body—you might notice tightness in your chest, a feeling of sleepiness, streaming energy, etc. And then just note and name it: “when Maggie got quiet, I felt a a tightness in my belly and a sense of uncertainty,” and let that be enough.</p>

<p>This ability to note and name is something that, with practice, you can also do out loud in conversation with other people. When someone gets unusually or unexpectedly quiet in a 1:1, for example you pause and just share what you are sensing and feeling, “Something just changed and I notice I feel a sense of hesitation and uncertainty. What happened for you?”</p>

<p>Nothing like going direct to the source to find out what is going on. :)</p>

<h3 id="out-there-vs-in-here">Out there vs in here</h3>
<p>A parallel process that works well with noticing and naming, is the ability to distinguish between what is happening outside of you, and what is happening inside. This is the difference between data and stories.</p>

<p>Data is something a camera would record, and belongs to the person or thing being observed, “out there” in the world. It is more descriptive and “factual” and has to do with the past and present. Data is not influenced by moods and emotions.</p>

<p>Stories add layers of meaning to data, and belong to the observer and say more about the observer and their internal world than the thing being observed. Stories are greatly influenced by moods and emotions and can be either be grounded or ungrounded. Grounded stories are backed up by observable data, while ungrounded stories tend to be based mostly on “vibes”.</p>

<p>As I said at the beginning of this piece, it’s not a problem that we navigate the world through stories, but we want those stories to be thoroughly grounded in data. Learning to do this as a leader can lead to greater clarity, stronger relationships, and a lot more curiosity (and if you’ve been reading me for any amount of time, you know how I feel about curiosity!).</p>

<p>A useful way to practice this is with the “Left Hand Column” technique developed by Chris Argyris. You can do this live in a meeting (probably don’t do it in a 1:1 until you’ve had a little practice) or reflectively about a conversation, interaction, meeting, etc.</p>

<p>It’s super simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On a piece of paper (or digital notebook/board), create two columns.</li>
  <li>Label the left hand column “Stories”. This is where you will capture what you are thinking and feeling.</li>
  <li>Label the right hand column “Data”. This is where you put what is being said or observed.</li>
  <li>As the meeting progresses, simply fill out each column.</li>
</ul>

<p>So for example, if someone says, “I’d like to see more data on that,” and that person happens to be someone you don’t particular get along with, your Left Hand Column might say something like, “So-and-so is always so skeptical and never trusts anyone… it slows us down so much!”.</p>

<p>That’s pretty much it. Courageous teams can actually share the Left Hand Column with each other, though that requires some additional guidance and this issue has already gone long!</p>

<p>So when a thought comes up about how someone is seeing you and you suspect your story might be kinda skewed, pause and look at the observable data you have. And then assess how much that data can really tell you, and where you might be filling in with extra story. As a former colleague liked to say, “In the absence of information, people fill in the apocalypse.”</p>

<p>Of course, asking people directly or using tools like a well-designed 360 can give you useful information about how others perceive you. But remember! You can never <em>really</em> know. Each person is a world, and their perception of you is filtered through their own stories. The best use of your energy is to stay grounded in your own experience, work with your own perceptive abilities, and trust that clarity within yourself creates clarity in how you show up for others.</p>

        <description>
          <![CDATA[
            <p>A lot of leaders I work with report feeling tired after their 1:1s.</p>

<p>There are a number of factors that contribute to this, but one of the most common is taking on almost all of the conversational work. The responsibility that comes with leading a team can make it easy to mistake effort for results, and 1:1s are where a lot of this efforting takes place.</p>

<p>This looks like asking all the questions, interpreting every situation, finding solutions, offering advice, and holding all the weight.</p>

<p>Picture a 1:1 with a large exercise ball sitting between the two people. As the conversation begins, the leader picks it up. The ball is big enough that it’s hard to see around, so they awkwardly try to maneuver it while talking. The leader holds it for about 80% of the conversation—which correlates to how much time they spend speaking. After 30 minutes, they put it down and leave wondering why they feel so exhausted.</p>

<h3 id="the-ball-of-responsibility">The Ball of Responsibility</h3>
<p>Claire Pedrick calls this The Ball of Responsibility, and it’s a useful way for leaders to reflect on where they might be taking on too much in conversations.</p>

<p>It’s hard to see at first because it feels like a natural part of leadership. We want to make sure our people are doing good work and delivering results, so we take on that burden for them. After all, isn’t that what leadership is about?</p>

<p>Yes and no. For good work and positive results to happen, responsibility needs to be shared. If leaders take on all of it, they create a vacuum of agency for their team in the near term and ensure dependency and compliance over time. If you’ve ever wondered why your team keeps coming to you for answers rather than developing their own, you’ve probably been holding the ball too much.</p>

<p>Now picture that 1:1 again, but this time the ball is sitting on the floor between the leader and their direct report. The responsibility is still there, clearly visible, but neither person is carrying it alone. It can move between them as the conversation needs.</p>

<h3 id="for-example">For example?</h3>
<p>What does this look like in practice? A familiar theme in 1:1s is interpersonal conflict:</p>

<p><strong>Holding the ball:</strong> “Alex and I keep butting heads on the technical approach. Every meeting turns into an argument.” The leader picks up the ball, already problem-solving. “This is slowing you both down. Let me talk to Alex and get his perspective, then I’ll meet with both of you separately and figure out a path forward. I’ll set something up for next week.” The conflict gets resolved, but the direct report hasn't learned how to navigate disagreement.</p>

<p><strong>Shared responsibility</strong>: “Alex and I aren’t aligned on the approach.” The leader resists the urge to mediate. “What have you already tried?” They listen as the direct report explains. “What would a productive conversation between you two look like? What would need to be different from how it’s been going?” The leader might offer coaching on how to have the conversation, but they’re not stepping in to have it for them.</p>

<p>Or maybe when someone is avoiding a difficult conversation:</p>

<p><strong>Holding the ball:</strong> “I’m concerned about Sarah’s work—the quality has been really inconsistent lately.” The leader immediately reaches for the ball. “Don’t worry, I’ll talk to her about it. I’ve been meaning to check in with her anyway. Let me handle this one.” The direct report feels relieved in the moment but doesn’t develop the skill to address performance issues on their own team.</p>

<p><strong>Shared responsibility:</strong> “I’m concerned about Sarah’s work.” The leader keeps the ball visible but does’t pick it up. “What conversation needs to happen here?” They explore together what specific feedback Sarah needs to hear and who’s best positioned to deliver it. “What support would help you have that conversation effectively?” The direct report might still feel nervous, but they’re building the muscle to handle these situations.</p>

<h3 id="try-it-out">Try It Out</h3>

<p>Over the next few weeks, when you head into your 1:1s, make the mental switch from “What problem can I solve for you today?” to “What needs to be discussed in order for you to feel able to move this forward?” You might be surprised how much energy you have left at the end of the day.</p>

        <title>Being Green in a World on Fire</title>

        <description>
          <![CDATA[
            <p>There is a simple check-in I like to use when I’m facilitating groups and coaching teams. Some of you may know it—it’s referred to as the Traffic Light Check-in. I picked the practice up from a <a href="https://reboot.io">Reboot</a> Circle I was in many years ago, and they in turn learned it from one of their former colleagues. Beyond that, I am unsure of its origin.</p>

<p>The practice is simple. Authentically answer the question, “How are you?” Use one of the colors of the traffic light (red, yellow, green/blue) to express your state, along with any other context you care to share.</p>

<p>Here is how Ali Schultz describes <a href="https://www.reboot.io/murmuration/">each of the colors</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Green means you feel safe, copasetic, or perhaps are in flow. You’re able to have eye-contact, creativity, play, humor. In a sense, all systems are go.</li>
  <li>Yellow is reactionary, meaning that the fight or flight impulse is present, as is perhaps some defensiveness.</li>
  <li>Red means your rational brain is offline, nervous system is shutting down such that you may or may not be present at all, or there may be a loss of trust.</li>
</ul>

<p>So a check-in might go something like, “I’m pretty green. I slept well and feel excited about the day, but there is quite a lot to get done.” Or maybe you are yellow, and you share the color and say something like, “I’m concerned about some of the upcoming deadlines around the new product launch and feeling stretched thin.”</p>

<p>When running these check-ins with designers, I get Pantone colors, gradients, patterns, you name it. People get pretty creative with expressing how they are doing through color.</p>

<p>What I’ve always liked about the method is that it’s quick, it offers people a chance to check-in with themselves and bring awareness to how they are feeling, and provides psychological safety because they don’t have to share any additional details that may feel uncomfortable or unsafe.</p>

<p>It also gives people a chance to support each other. For the yellow check-in above, a few people might offer their time after the meeting to run through the concerns and see if anything needs to be adjusted or addressed. I once reported red in a meeting due to some stuff going on in my personal life, and the team rallied around me, volunteering to take on extra work so that I could take care of myself. And I didn’t have to share all the messy details, only that I was showing up as red.</p>

<p>The colors apparently map to the nervous system in the style of Polyvagal theory—green meaning you are in the rest and digest mode of the parasympathetic nervous system, yellow indicates sympathetic activation of the fight/flight response, and red is freeze, aka dorsal collapse.</p>

<h3 id="is-it-okay-to-be-green">Is it okay to be green?</h3>
<p>I introduced this check-in to a group of deeply caring folks who work in a high-stress, high-stakes environment and who are feeling the impact of federal funding cuts for at-risk communities.</p>

<p>They picked up the color language immediately and pointed to a challenge inherent in their work—they were always yellow, all the time, by the very nature of what they did. Could they even be green?</p>

<p>As the conversation unfolded, something even more fundamental came to light. Many of these kind and capable people held a core belief that is not okay to be green in a world that is on fire (both literally and metaphorically for this Los Angeles based team).</p>

<p>I will note that when I teach the traffic light check-in, I describe green as being present and able to tend to what is needed in the moment. I do not talk about being copasetic or creativity, play, and humor. Yes, these things are all totally part of what can happen in green states, but they aren’t all that can happen.</p>

<h3 id="what-being-green-really-means">What being green really means</h3>
<p>Being green means that we have the capacity to be with whatever is showing up without getting so activated we can’t respond.  It doesn’t necessarily mean we are in a great mood, joyful, and full of creative energy, though that is absolutely possible. It does mean that we are relaxed and open, responsive and present, and able to fully feel the feels.</p>

<p>Being green means being attuned to our emotions. The ones that lift us up into connected and creative states, and the ones that show up when we encounter a world that doesn’t align with our values.</p>

<p>The key to being green is being present and feeling what shows up, rather than fusing with emotions or suppressing them to the point they eat away at us from the inside. It is not the presence of a “negative” emotion that indicates yellow or red, but how we <em>are</em> with that emotion.</p>

<p>It is entirely possible to be green and sad. Or red and joyful.</p>

<h3 id="embodied-self-awareness">Embodied Self-Awareness</h3>
<p>To understand this, I want to briefly remap the definitions of the colors based on Alan Fogel’s research on Embodied Self-Awareness (ESA).</p>

<p>The basic idea (and I am over simplifying for the sake of brevity) behind ESA is that it is the ability <em>feel</em> ourselves as living, sensing beings that invokes the parasympathetic rest-and-digest response. When we <em>think</em> about ourselves conceptually we are invoking various neural networks in the brain that rely on the sympathetic nervous system. It is only when we can drop fully into the experiencing self that we can access the restorative qualities of emotions.</p>

<p>In this model, green is a restorative state in which we are able to fully embrace any felt experience—pleasure or pain, happiness or grief—that arises in the present moment without judgmental or censoring thoughts. This state involves complete presence with whatever we’re feeling, sustained long enough to create a lasting sense of relief, deeper breathing, or spreading warmth and relaxation.</p>

<p>Yellow is a modulated state where we have the capacity to alternate between focused activity and brief moments of reconnecting with our felt experience. In this state, we can stay engaged with tasks and challenges while maintaining enough body awareness to know when we need to pause, breathe, or tend to what our body is telling us. Most of us live primarily in this state.</p>

<p>Red means we feel stuck and cannot modulate our felt experience, thoughts, or nervous system activation. There’s no space to breathe, no rest, no relief. We feel trapped in painful emotions, ruminative thoughts, or overwhelming sensations without the ability to shift or find perspective.</p>

<h3 id="on-sadness-and-joy">On sadness and joy</h3>
<p>Let’s run through red, yellow, and green for sadness and joy, to get a sense of how this works.</p>

<p><strong>Red sadness:</strong> In red states, it is common for feelings to be suppressed. Sadness often comes with the physiological counterpart of crying, which has a number of health benefits. When people suppress crying, the sadness is internalized and can fuel ongoing rumination about negative experiences, which leads to feelings of exhaustion and burnout. When crying does happen in a red state, it is the sympathetic nervous system that stays activated so the tears don’t have the soothing effect they would if sadness was experienced in a yellow or green state. This type of crying tends to be needy, self-centered, and manipulative.</p>

<p><strong>Yellow sadness:</strong> Sadness in a yellow state frequently allows the tears to flow with the understanding that crying contains the possibility of alleviating some of the distress.</p>

<p><strong>Green sadness:</strong> Sadness in a green state has a different quality. Crying brings relief and surrender. The tears that come contain certain proteins and stress hormones that flush stress-related chemicals and shift the body into a relaxation response. It is in this state that crying activates the parasympathetic nervous system and can bring in a sense of relief and restoration.</p>

<p><strong>Red joy:</strong> In a red state, joy is usually found in things that can temporarily numb the pain. This can look like addiction, risk taking, lashing out, or being manic. These actions, while they do bring relief for short periods of time, do not activate the soothing side of the parasympathetic nervous system, often keeping someone in dorsal freeze or sympathetic activation.</p>

<p><strong>Yellow joy:</strong> Joy in yellow states tends to center around high energy excitement that brings a sense of intensity, focus, and engagement. This is very typical of “flow” states experiences in sports, creative work, musical performances, etc. These states work in conjunction with sympathetic activation in the form of eustress, the positive kind of stress that stretches and challenges us. As opposed to distress which can push us into overwhelm and closer to red states.</p>

<p><strong>Green joy:</strong> Joy in this state comes with a sense of deep okayness. The body relaxes and lets go of protective tension, there may be a sense of warmth and release, or the possibility for restoration and healing. People often feel qualities of presence like contentment, peace, and aliveness. Others share they experience total surrender, compassion, love, and receptivity. The face softens and people often appear younger and with bright, smiling eyes.</p>

<h3 id="seconds">90 seconds</h3>
<p>It is true that emotions generally take around 90 seconds to run their course. But that is ONLY if we are in a green state of presence. When we have the capacity to be with the emotion and fully feel it, without needing to analyze, control, or act it out, the emotion can find a path to show up, share its message with us, and then subside. But if we mess with it in any way, then that emotion is going to hang around for a lot longer.</p>

<p>I’ve spoken about my Kung Fu training in previous issues, and once again there are useful lessons that can be applied here. Being green is about being open, present, and relaxed. Aware and responsive to whatever might show up.</p>

<p>If I have my fist out in front of me and my arm tense, just waiting like for something to show that I can fight, by the time a real threat shows up my arm is going to be stiff, tired, and exhausted. I’ve wasted all my energy staying tense and waiting.</p>

<p>Instead, I practice staying relaxed, open, and present. If something shows up that needs attention, I am ready to respond with the right amount of energy and effort. I use timing and physics to keep myself safe and contain my opponent.</p>

<p>The same goes for being green.</p>

<h3 id="on-being-green">On being green</h3>
<p>So I want to say, to all those caring leaders out there, it is absolutely okay to be green.</p>

<p>We <em>need</em> you to be green. Be present and open. Feel the emotions that come through and let them flow. Not just the ones that alert you to what isn’t right in the world, but the ones that remind you of what is <em>already</em> right. The wonder of being alive, the love you have for special people in your life, the joy of connection and doing something meaningful.</p>

<p>Strong emotions, the ones typically classified as “negative” don’t have to keep you tense to the point of exhaustion—they have a restorative quality when felt in a state of being green. For example, restorative anger reminds us of what really matters and gives us the energy to take a stand for what we care about. It is entirely possible to wake up everyday and say “NO” without overwhelming your body with stress to the point of exhaustion.</p>

<p>If we stay tense and reactive, then we are easily knocked over. Our resources are always depleted and we don’t have enough to meet the moments that matter.</p>

<p>Green helps us connect to our emotions, we allow them all but we do this skillfully so that we can fully utilize the gifts of these emotions. If we do this unskillfully then we explode, collapse, or become lost in dogma. Such reactions aren’t in service of life and justice, and often they wind up perpetuating the status quo.</p>

<p>Being green is <em>exactly</em> how you show up in a world on fire.</p>

        <description>
          <![CDATA[
            <p>One of the biggest challenges of leadership is shared knowledge.</p>

<p>Usually we think this covers business-related knowledge: mission and vision, customer behavior, quarterly and yearly goals, jobs to be done, market dynamics, and organizational context. Which is not wrong, but <em>is</em> incomplete.</p>

<p>It’s not just knowledge about the business that needs to be shared, but ways of working, behaving, communicating, and responding, which can be a particular blind spot of leadership. Leaders do what is obvious to them, and assume that same thing must be obvious to others.</p>

<p>And because this is a blind spot, leaders can get pretty worked up when people fail to do the very things that seem obvious to them. They get frustrated, make up stories, and blame the team, rather than just, you know, tell people about those obvious and common sense things they expect them to do.</p>

<p>This gets even more tricky when you consider the foibles of human communication. What I say is often not what people hear, even though <em>I</em> think I’ve perfectly said what I mean. And I usually won’t find out until after the fact, when what I thought I communicated fails to manifest (in which case I am probably going to blame the other party and not myself!).</p>

<p>Thankfully, there are a few things you can do to  keep these misses from happening and get everyone on the same page.</p>

<h3 id="getting-clear-together">Getting Clear Together</h3>

<p>First, say out loud, and as clearly as you can, what your expectations are.</p>

<p>Here is an expectation I have: “I expect that people will arrive to meetings on time and prepared, and if they can’t make it or will be late, will let me know at least 24 hours prior.”</p>

<p>Second, figure out if what you said has been understood the way you intended it. “Is this clear? What questions do you have?”</p>

<p>In the case above, one question might be, “How should we let you know?” Another might be, “What if the meeting is on Monday morning?” Someone else might wonder about what being prepared for a meeting looks like or what counts as “late”.</p>

<p>See what I mean? What seems clear to you actually isn’t all that clear when tested against the perspective, experience, and work history of others.</p>

<p>Once you've gotten clear together, the next step is to find out if folks agree with what you shared. Just because you expect people to behave a certain way doesn’t mean it will resonate or be acceptable to them. They might have some other ideas around meeting protocols.</p>

<p>Whether they agree immediately or you spend some time workshopping it together, the finally step is to write down what you agreed to in a place everyone can easily refer to it when needed.</p>

<h3 id="from-expectations-to-shared-agreements">From Expectations to Shared Agreements</h3>

<p>The process just described is what is commonly referred to in the coaching world as “expectations and agreements”. Expectations exist in your head, and if you don’t share them you set yourself up for continuous disappointment because <em>people can’t read your mind</em>.</p>

<p>The alternative is to create a set of shared agreements—expectations that are shared out loud, agreed to or modified, and then written down for reference. Shared agreements usually exist as “living documents” that can be updated or modified at anytime, to keep the system responsive and flexible.</p>

<p>A good sign you are holding an expectation that would be better as a shared agreement is frustration and negative judgements that people just don’t “get it.” What is it they don’t get? Surface that expectation and share it! If you have ever thought to yourself, “Well, I do X, so why aren’t they doing X?” that is a great sign of an unshared expectation! Put it out into the open!</p>

<p>Here are some of the shared agreements I use with each cohort of Leader as Coach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everything is welcome: Whatever shows up in class is welcome. We bring compassion, appreciation and non-judgement to each other and to this work.</li>
  <li>We take care of ourselves: We don’t need to ask permission to do what we need to tend to ourselves. We will let people know when we need to step away.</li>
  <li>Commitment: We are committed to each other and this learning container throughout our time together. This means active participation in sessions, completing weekly experiments, sharing reflections, and communicating proactively if challenges arise.</li>
  <li>Psychological Safety: We are here to learn and support each other in that learning. We commit to supporting, listening, and giving space without judgement for people to share openly. We hold positive intent and give people the benefit of the doubt, and do our best to hold back from fixing, directing, and giving advice without consent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Creating a set of shared agreements with your team can be transformative. Not only are your expectations clear and out in the open, but because they are created collaboratively, everyone feels invested. People aren’t being told what to do, they are collectively shaping team behavior.</p>

<p>This also means you waste a lot less energy feeling frustrated and ruminating about why people aren’t doing or responding in ways you think they should. It’s a big world. We’ve all been shaped by different upbringings, education, cultures, and work experiences. Do yourself and your team a favor and say as clearly as you can what you want, and then explore that together.</p>

<h3 id="you-expectations---agreements-checklist">You expectations -&gt; agreements checklist:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Have I said it out loud?</li>
  <li>Have people understood it?</li>
  <li>Do they agree with it?</li>
  <li>If not, what can we come up with as an alternative?</li>
  <li>Have we written it down where everyone can find it?</li>
</ul>

        <description>
          <![CDATA[
            <p>I must have been around 10 or 11 years old the winter I realized how vast the universe was.</p>

<p>A storm tumbled through our town leaving eight inches of snow in its wake. The next day the temperature warmed enough to rain and then rapidly dropped below zero, transforming the top inches of snow into a thick layer of ice—a hardy crust that you could walk on top of and not break through. For adults this was probably a pain in the butt, but for us kids it was a magical playground.</p>

<p>It only took one stupidly fast and uncontrollable run down the hill in our back yard for my brother and I to realize how treacherous the situation was. Normally we could maneuver our sleds into a controlled landing by dragging one or both arms in the snow, like a rudder, and easily avoid crashing into the pine trees lining the bottom. But with the ice there was no dragging, only careening, our tiny faces slapped with pine needles before an unceremonious and sudden encounter with a tree trunk.</p>

<p>We also realized we couldn’t make it back up the hill, everything was so slippery. We had to chip hand holes into the ice with sticks to create anchors so we wouldn't slide to the bottom and have to start the climb all over.</p>

<p>Eventually we ditched our sleds and created a new game. We covered the ice in a grid of hand holds. Starting at the top of the hill, snowsuit stomach down, we launched ourselves. There was enough momentum that you could grab onto a hole and change your direction, spinning around a few times before catching another. Kind of like if Plinko were etched into the side of a hill, with kids bonking around instead of a giant coin.</p>

<p>It was such fun we stayed out well past dinner time. My brother was the first to get tired and go inside. I stayed out to do a few more runs.</p>

<p>By this point it was dark, the night crisp. Halfway down the hill I flipped over and looked up. The spiral arm of the Milky Way slashed across the inky sky, stars twinkling in every direction.</p>

<p>The warm light from the living room spilled down the hill, its meniscus stopping just short of where I lay sprawled. We had been learning about space at school (Jupiter was my favorite planet) and I knew that each point of light dotting the sky was incredibly far away.</p>

<p>So far away that what I was looking at might not be there any longer, the distance between us like a time machine turning the clock back a millennia. I had the sudden realization I was looking into the past.</p>

<p>Everything inverted.</p>

<p>I understood how small I was, and how alive. I felt the cold of the icy snow and the familiarity of the backyard I knew so well—the oak to my right and maple to my left, the pine trees lining the bottom of the hill, and the little nook behind them where we buried beloved pets. All of us there under the vast canopy of time and space, the night quiet and perfect. I could see my breath as I gazed into the vastness of space, completely mesmerized.</p>

<p>I was in awe.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="a-brief-detour-into-the-body">A Brief Detour into the Body</h2>

<p>For the last few months I’ve been designing an offsite for leaders around somatic resilience practices. The central theme is that the body is essential to our well-being, but in order for it to serve in its full function, we have to be able to <em>feel</em> it (not just think about it) and understand what it is saying.</p>

<p>The body is the first to sense when we are moving into unhealthy behaviors (to name a few: working too much, being in activated states for too long, pushing through, “leaning in”, you know the drill…) and sending signals to slow down. But when we have been in prolonged states of “grinding” our biology works against us.</p>

<p>In order to grind we have to push our body into “survival mode”, at least neurochemically. Prolonged states of stress pump cortisol into the bloodstream so we can keep going, which reinforces activation of the nervous system. This process necessarily numbs our ability to feel what is happening in our body so that we can keep going, and also happens to be a recipe for burnout.</p>

<p>When we’ve been pushing for so long, disconnected from the felt-sense of what the body needs and wants, it can be hard to find real rest, the kind that actually begins to restore a baseline of normal functioning.</p>

<h2 id="the-awe-shortcut">The Awe Shortcut</h2>

<p>In my research I’ve come to learn that awe is rather unique when it comes to human emotion. It can act as a short cut for dropping the body into a restorative, expansive state. When awe is activated our thinking mind gets quiet, creating space to reconnect to something much greater than ourselves (which happens to be really good for us).</p>

<p>Let's be clear, I'm not saying awe is a panacea that will fix everything, but it deserves some attention for at least cutting through the bullshit of our ego for a short bit of time.</p>

<p>No other emotion can do this. Most emotions can be experienced in any state our nervous system is in—restorative where we feel the fullness of an emotion without editorializing, modulated where we both feel and analyze, or dysregulated where the emotion takes over and pushes us into fight or flight mode.</p>

<p>But not awe! Awe generates a state of relaxation, an absence of thinking, and the feeling of being completely in the present moment. You cannot experience dysregulation and awe at the same time.</p>

<p>This matters because these days we’re all pretty activated by the uncertainty of the world. Our nervous systems seem perilously and persistently close to the edge, making it damn hard to find enough restoration to feel truly nourished and resourced (infinite scrolling and social media are decidedly <em>not</em> restorative activities).</p>

<p>So you can meditate a bunch, go on wellness retreats, drop yourself into a sensory deprivation tank or… just experience awe. You don’t have to go far—opening up to wonder and listening to your favorite music, spending some time in nature, or getting down with amazing art are all ways to connect with awe.</p>

<h2 id="try-it-out">Try it Out</h2>

<p>Here’s an easy one you can start doing right now: every day, for the next two weeks, commit to taking a 15 minute walk. Focus on being completely present and seeing everything “new” as if from a child’s perspective. As Kai Sky recommends, “Imagine something that gives you joy. Got it? Now go and be like that all day long. (Yes, it is that simple…).”</p>

<p>I also recorded a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Rp4nSgfWZ__tFs-aK94Vvl-caO9V4jS/view?usp=sharing">short, guided meditation</a> you can use to connect with a past experience of awe to use as a resource. Over time, the image or memory may fade, but the imprint of the somatic state will remain.</p>

        <description>
          <![CDATA[
            <p>Picture a time when someone physically grabbed you. Not necessarily in a threatening way, though these types of grabs happen too. Maybe a friend pulled you back from walking into a busy street or a colleague was trying get your attention as you walked by at a conference.</p>

<p>Do you remember what happened? How your body responded before you had a chance to think? You were probably activated in some habitual way—muscles tense, cortisol released, a little bit of a recoil as you automatically assessed the threat level.</p>

<p>Even if the person who grabbed you did it in a “friendly” way, it demanded your attention, your nervous system shifting into protective mode. You probably weren’t aware of anything else in that moment, and afterwards it might have taken you some time to return to equilibrium.</p>

<h3 id="daily-grabs">Daily Grabs</h3>

<p>Now imagine being grabbed a hundred times a day, because that's what happens! Not physically, but mentally and emotionally. Work place conflicts, news cycles, inner critics, societal expectations, uncertainty—there are so many ways we can be grabbed. And the nervous system doesn't care what the source is, so it will respond in the same way it does to a physical grab.</p>

<p>Let’s say you have an interaction with your boss that feels off. You have the thought that your boss doesn’t like you (which feels really threatening), and your body reacts—you tense up, constrict your breathing, pull away, and try and control your reaction. Which usually creates a negative feedback loop of increasing intensity—nervous system is activated, the physical sensations of discomfort become stronger, and the worry thoughts amp up.</p>

<p>What happens when this negative feedback loop continues for days, weeks, or even months? Where each day at work you are constantly on the lookout for signals of how your boss feels about you, picking apart the smallest details of a comment or obsessively comparing how your boss reacts to others in order to figure out where you stand. In this increased state of vigilance, the smallest thing can knock you over.</p>

<p>If you take this same approach in martial arts, your attacker will easily win. Your reactive state keeps you off balance and up in your head, responding from instinct while trying to “figure out” what to do.</p>

<h3 id="centering">Centering</h3>

<p>The antidote to this is centering. In the physical body, center is about two or three fingers below the belly button, and back a bit, closer to the spine. Try moving your attention there now, from your head to your physical center. Bring your breath all the way down, as if you were breathing from this place in your body. Feel what shifts.</p>

<p>You might notice some tension is released in the neck and shoulders. Or you might feel more of your legs. Maybe your peripheral vision widens, or you feel a little more connected to yourself, more present.</p>

<p>Centering doesn’t keep the grabs from happening, but it helps us see them coming. And when we can see them, we have choice in how we respond. We can choose not to engage, we can blend with the energy and move it another direction, we can block and counter attack—from a centered place the options are plenty.</p>

<p>This applies equally in the boardroom as it does on the mat. Centering helps us be more rooted, open, and responsive. And the more familiar we are with center, the easier it is to come back to it when something pulls us away.</p>

<p>Centering keeps us balanced under pressure. Think of a recent meeting you’ve been in, one that was challenging in some way or another. Your awareness was probably concentrated in your upper body from the shoulders on up. You might have noticed some tension, and that your thoughts were focused on the exchange of words, or on crafting your own verbal response. As the meeting progressed, it might have felt more and more adversarial.</p>

<p>We aren’t balanced when we center in the head. Centering from the body reminds us that interactions don’t just happen with words, but between bodies. When we shift attention to our belly center, physical tension is released, breathing deepens, and the nervous system settles. This changes how we speak, listen, and act, leading to new outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="try-it-out">Try It Out</h3>

<p>Place your hands, one on top of the other, about three fingers below your belly button. Take three slow breaths, imagining each inhale traveling all the way down to fill the space under your lower hand. As you exhale, let your shoulders drop and soften.</p>

<p>Notice what shifts—perhaps your jaw unclenches, your vision widens, or you simply feel more present in your body.</p>

<p>This same practice works beautifully in meetings. When you feel that familiar “grab”—an unexpected question, pushback on your idea, or tension in the room—take a moment to breathe into your center. You don’t need to close your eyes or make it obvious.</p>

<p>Simply shift your attention from your racing thoughts down to that steady place in your belly.</p>

<p>From there, you might find yourself listening more deeply, speaking with more clarity, or discovering a response you couldn’t access when you were centered in your head.</p>

<p>Keep practicing this during the week, especially in calm moments. The more you experience center, the easier it is to come back to it when something tries to grab you.</p>

        <title>Unbundling Leadership</title>
        <link>https://methodandmatter.com//words-make-worlds/unbundling-leadership/</link>

        <description>
          <![CDATA[
            <p>Unbundling is a business strategy that seeks to take things apart with the purpose of creating a more functional or competitive business. GE, under Jack Welch, spun off or sold underperforming business units in order to focus on the most profitable divisions, Craigslist unbundled classified ad revenue from traditional newspapers, and the shift to digital distribution unbundled songs from an album in the form of MP3s.</p>

<p>Leadership strikes me as something else that could benefit from unbundling. Not as a theoretical term, but as the practical application of what happens when someone steps into a formal leadership role. By this I mean a role that, in addition to vision and influence, comes with positional power, responsibility for a team and/or function, and possibly P&amp;L responsibilities.</p>

<p>When you step into a leadership role you’re often expected to get on with the work without much guidance or training. The new responsibilities, relationships, and altitude you need to think at are at best loosely defined in a career matrix, but more commonly have to be inferred from the organizational environment.</p>

<p>Faced with this murkiness, leaders take a number of approaches—mirroring the leaders around them, becoming the type of leader they always wanted but never had, or staying heads down and focusing on the work.</p>

<p>What I wish I had known, when I stepped into my first leadership role, is that leadership is a bundle of four different and somewhat distinct areas of responsibility: holding and communicating the vision, delivering outcomes, running the business, and developing talent. Each corresponds to a different role: leader, director, manager, and coach. While in practice the four blend together, it can be helpful to understand the distinct configuration of each.</p>

<h2 id="lead">Lead</h2>
<p>Leadership is the embodiment of vision and values in action. Leaders connect people to purpose, make meaning of challenges, and inspire collective movement towards shared goals. The mindset of a leader is oriented towards the future, possibility, and innovation.</p>

<p>Key responsibilities include creating and communicating the vision, aligning efforts with core values, listening to what is happening in organization, helping people understand the “why”, and showing how individual and team work contributes to larger organizational goals.</p>

<p>Leaders must do this both for the people on the team/function/department they are in charge of, and also for their colleagues across the organization. They are responsible for making sure that the work they are responsible for is understood across the company and <em>why</em> it matters in the first place.</p>

<h3 id="reflection-questions">Reflection questions:</h3>

<h4 id="vision--purpose">Vision &amp; Purpose:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How effectively am I translating abstract vision into concrete, relatable terms for my team?</li>
  <li>What stories am I telling that help people see themselves in our shared future?</li>
  <li>Does our vision still resonate with the team's evolving needs?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="influence--inspiration">Influence &amp; Inspiration:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Am I modeling the behaviors and values I want to see in others?</li>
  <li>How do I respond when my vision meets resistance or skepticism?</li>
  <li>What legacy am I creating through my leadership decisions?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="organizational-impact">Organizational Impact:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How well do I understand the broader ecosystem my team operates within?</li>
  <li>Where might I be inadvertently creating silos or barriers to collaboration?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="direct">Direct</h2>
<p>Directing is the practice of setting clear targets and making decisive choices about priorities and resource allocation. Directors focus on outcomes, establish boundaries, and make the calls that keep work moving forward. The mindset of directing orients towards clarity, decisiveness, and results.</p>

<p>Key responsibilities include defining outcomes and what success looks like, establishing non-negotiables, making clear decisions about priorities, setting timelines and milestones, and ensuring accountability for outcomes.</p>

<p>While directing shares some territory with managing, the distinction lies in focus: management is about systems and processes that create predictability, while directing is about outcomes and the decisions that drive toward specific results.</p>

<h3 id="reflection-questions-1">Reflection Questions:</h3>

<h4 id="clarity--focus">Clarity &amp; Focus:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How clearly can my team articulate our top three priorities right now?</li>
  <li>Where am I creating confusion by trying to accomplish too many things at once?</li>
  <li>What decisions am I avoiding that are creating ambiguity for others?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="decision-making">Decision-Making:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How quickly do I make decisions when the path forward is uncertain?</li>
  <li>Where might my desire for consensus be slowing down necessary action?</li>
  <li>When did I last change direction based on new information—and how clearly did I communicate why?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="accountability--outcomes">Accountability &amp; Outcomes:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Do people know exactly what they’re accountable for delivering?</li>
  <li>How do I respond when outcomes aren’t being met?</li>
  <li>Where might I be measuring activity instead of results?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="manage">Manage</h2>
<p>Management is the practice of running a business—orchestrating work systems and processes to achieve predictable outcomes. The mindset of a manager orients towards operational excellence and structured thinking.</p>

<p>Key responsibilities include setting clear expectations in the form of shared agreements, establishing effective processes, identifying metrics of success, ensuring efficient resource allocation, and maintaining stability and consistency.</p>

<p>It is worthwhile to note that the role of manager and leader can often be at odds. While the role of leader orients towards new possibilities through innovation, the role of manager is focused on healthy and repeatable processes. Leadership can be a destabilizing threat to management predictability.</p>

<h3 id="reflection-questions-2">Reflection Questions:</h3>

<h4 id="systems--processes">Systems &amp; Processes:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>What friction points are slowing down our team’s ability to deliver results?</li>
  <li>How do I balance standardization with the need for flexibility?</li>
  <li>Which meetings, reports, or processes could we eliminate without losing value?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="performance--accountability">Performance &amp; Accountability:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How quickly do I address performance gaps when they arise?</li>
  <li>Am I giving people the tools and resources they need to succeed?</li>
  <li>What would happen if I wasn't here for a week—would things run smoothly?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="resource-optimization">Resource Optimization:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Where am I over-investing or under-investing our team’s time and energy?</li>
  <li>How effectively am I protecting my team from organizational noise and distractions?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="coach">Coach</h2>
<p>Coaching is way of developing talent by supporting people to achieve the results they want through self-awareness and behavior change. The mindset of a coach is one of curiosity and learning, a willingness to let go of knowing the answer and trust that each person has the capacity to figure out their own path forward.</p>

<p>Key responsibilities for the coaching role cover creating space for reflection, asking powerful questions, supporting others to connect with their inner wisdom, and expanding how people observe and understand the situations they find themselves in.</p>

<p>Mentorship also falls under the umbrella of coaching. The way I distinguish between the two is that coaching is designed to connect someone to their own inner knowing with support from the coach in the form of questions and observations, while mentorship is oriented around a more senior person sharing insights from hard-won experience in order to help a more junior person grow.</p>

<h3 id="reflection-questions-3">Reflection Questions:</h3>

<h4 id="development--growth">Development &amp; Growth:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>What assumptions am I making about what each person needs to grow?</li>
  <li>How often do I ask “What do you think?” before offering my own perspective?</li>
  <li>When have I seen someone surprise themselves with their own capability?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="creating-safety">Creating Safety:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How comfortable do people feel bringing me problems or admitting mistakes?</li>
  <li>What signals might I be sending that discourage open dialogue?</li>
  <li>How do I respond when someone's approach differs from what I would do?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="letting-go">Letting Go:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Where am I solving problems that others could solve themselves?</li>
  <li>How do I distinguish between when to step in and when to step back?</li>
  <li>What would it look like to be less helpful in service of others’ growth?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>It is important to note that within each of these roles there is a wide range of variability. How you lead, manage, and coach will be shaped by your experiences, values, and beliefs about how good work gets done (and what qualifies as good work in the first place).</p>

<p>Give it a try this week—track each of your days and see where you lead, manage, and coach. You might find one role is more comfortable for you or that certain contexts require one role over the others. There is no one right way, but I hope that unbundling these three roles gives you useful insight to be more impactful as a leader.</p>
