        <description>
          <![CDATA[
            <p>One of the biggest challenges of leadership is shared knowledge.</p>

<p>Usually we think this covers business-related knowledge: mission and vision, customer behavior, quarterly and yearly goals, jobs to be done, market dynamics, and organizational context. Which is not wrong, but <em>is</em> incomplete.</p>

<p>It’s not just knowledge about the business that needs to be shared, but ways of working, behaving, communicating, and responding, which can be a particular blind spot of leadership. Leaders do what is obvious to them, and assume that same thing must be obvious to others.</p>

<p>And because this is a blind spot, leaders can get pretty worked up when people fail to do the very things that seem obvious to them. They get frustrated, make up stories, and blame the team, rather than just, you know, tell people about those obvious and common sense things they expect them to do.</p>

<p>This gets even more tricky when you consider the foibles of human communication. What I say is often not what people hear, even though <em>I</em> think I’ve perfectly said what I mean. And I usually won’t find out until after the fact, when what I thought I communicated fails to manifest (in which case I am probably going to blame the other party and not myself!).</p>

<p>Thankfully, there are a few things you can do to  keep these misses from happening and get everyone on the same page.</p>

<h3 id="getting-clear-together">Getting Clear Together</h3>

<p>First, say out loud, and as clearly as you can, what your expectations are.</p>

<p>Here is an expectation I have: “I expect that people will arrive to meetings on time and prepared, and if they can’t make it or will be late, will let me know at least 24 hours prior.”</p>

<p>Second, figure out if what you said has been understood the way you intended it. “Is this clear? What questions do you have?”</p>

<p>In the case above, one question might be, “How should we let you know?” Another might be, “What if the meeting is on Monday morning?” Someone else might wonder about what being prepared for a meeting looks like.</p>

<p>See what I mean? What seems clear to you actually isn’t all that clear when tested against the perspective, experience, and work history of others.</p>

<p>Once you've gotten clear together, the next step is to find out if folks agree with it. Just because you expect people to behave a certain way doesn’t mean it will resonate or be acceptable to them. They might have some other ideas around meeting protocols.</p>

<p>Whether they agree immediately or you spend some time workshopping it together, the finally step is to write down what you agreed to in a place everyone can easily find and refer to whenever needed.</p>

<h3 id="from-expectations-to-shared-agreements">From Expectations to Shared Agreements</h3>

<p>The process I described here is what is commonly referred to in the coaching world as going from expectations to shared agreements. Expectations exist in your head, and if you don’t share them you set yourself for continuous disappointment because <em>people can’t read your mind</em>.</p>

<p>The alternative is to create a set of shared agreements—expectations that are shared out loud, agreed to or modified, and then written down for reference. Shared agreements usually exist as “living documents” that can be updated or modified at anytime, to keep the system responsive and flexible.</p>

<p>A good sign you are holding an expectation that would be better as a shared agreement is frustration and negative judgements that people just don’t “get it.” What is it they don’t get? Surface that expectation and share it! If you have ever thought to yourself, “Well, I do X, so why aren’t they doing X?” that is a great sign of an unshared expectation! Put it out into the open!</p>

<p>Here are some of the shared agreements I use with each cohort of Leader as Coach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everything is welcome: Whatever shows up in class is welcome. We bring compassion, appreciation and non-judgement to each other and to this work.</li>
  <li>We take care of ourselves: We don’t need to ask permission to do what we need to tend to ourselves. We will let people know when we need to step away.</li>
  <li>Commitment: We are committed to each other and this learning container throughout our time together. This means active participation in sessions, completing weekly experiments, sharing reflections, and communicating proactively if challenges arise.</li>
  <li>Psychological Safety: We are here to learn and support each other in that learning. We commit to supporting, listening, and giving space without judgement for people to share openly. We hold positive intent and give people the benefit of the doubt, and do our best to hold back from fixing, directing, and giving advice without consent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Creating a set of shared agreements with your team can be transformative. Not only are your expectations clear and out in the open, but because they are created collaboratively, everyone feels invested. They aren’t being told what to do, they are collectively shaping team behavior.</p>

<p>This also means you waste a lot less energy feeling frustrated and ruminating about why people aren’t doing or responding in ways you think they should. It’s a big world. We’ve all been shaped by different upbringings, education, cultures, and work experiences. Do yourself and your team a favor and say as clearly as you can what you want, and then explore that together.</p>

<h3 id="you-expectations---agreements-checklist">You expectations -&gt; agreements checklist:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Have I said it out loud?</li>
  <li>Have people understood it?</li>
  <li>Do they agree with it?</li>
  <li>If not, what can we come up with as an alternative?</li>
  <li>Have we written it down where everyone can find it?</li>
</ul>

        <description>
          <![CDATA[
            <p>I must have been around 10 or 11 years old the winter I realized how vast the universe was.</p>

<p>A storm tumbled through our town leaving eight inches of snow in its wake. The next day the temperature warmed enough to rain and then rapidly dropped below zero, transforming the top inches of snow into a thick layer of ice—a hardy crust that you could walk on top of and not break through. For adults this was probably a pain in the butt, but for us kids it was a magical playground.</p>

<p>It only took one stupidly fast and uncontrollable run down the hill in our back yard for my brother and I to realize how treacherous the situation was. Normally we could maneuver our sleds into a controlled landing by dragging one or both arms in the snow, like a rudder, and easily avoid crashing into the pine trees lining the bottom. But with the ice there was no dragging, only careening, our tiny faces slapped with pine needles before an unceremonious and sudden encounter with a tree trunk.</p>

<p>We also realized we couldn’t make it back up the hill, everything was so slippery. We had to chip hand holes into the ice with sticks to create anchors so we wouldn't slide to the bottom and have to start the climb all over.</p>

<p>Eventually we ditched our sleds and created a new game. We covered the ice in a grid of hand holds. Starting at the top of the hill, snowsuit stomach down, we launched ourselves. There was enough momentum that you could grab onto a hole and change your direction, spinning around a few times before catching another. Kind of like if Plinko were etched into the side of a hill, with kids bonking around instead of a giant coin.</p>

<p>It was such fun we stayed out well past dinner time. My brother was the first to get tired and go inside. I stayed out to do a few more runs.</p>

<p>By this point it was dark, the night crisp. Halfway down the hill I flipped over and looked up. The spiral arm of the Milky Way slashed across the inky sky, stars twinkling in every direction.</p>

<p>The warm light from the living room spilled down the hill, its meniscus stopping just short of where I lay sprawled. We had been learning about space at school (Jupiter was my favorite planet) and I knew that each point of light dotting the sky was incredibly far away.</p>

<p>So far away that what I was looking at might not be there any longer, the distance between us like a time machine turning the clock back a millennia. I had the sudden realization I was looking into the past.</p>

<p>Everything inverted.</p>

<p>I understood how small I was, and how alive. I felt the cold of the icy snow and the familiarity of the backyard I knew so well—the oak to my right and maple to my left, the pine trees lining the bottom of the hill, and the little nook behind them where we buried beloved pets. All of us there under the vast canopy of time and space, the night quiet and perfect. I could see my breath as I gazed into the vastness of space, completely mesmerized.</p>

<p>I was in awe.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="a-brief-detour-into-the-body">A Brief Detour into the Body</h2>

<p>For the last few months I’ve been designing an offsite for leaders around somatic resilience practices. The central theme is that the body is essential to our well-being, but in order for it to serve in its full function, we have to be able to <em>feel</em> it (not just think about it) and understand what it is saying.</p>

<p>The body is the first to sense when we are moving into unhealthy behaviors (to name a few: working too much, being in activated states for too long, pushing through, “leaning in”, you know the drill…) and sending signals to slow down. But when we have been in prolonged states of “grinding” our biology works against us.</p>

<p>In order to grind we have to push our body into “survival mode”, at least neurochemically. Prolonged states of stress pump cortisol into the bloodstream so we can keep going, which reinforces activation of the nervous system. This process necessarily numbs our ability to feel what is happening in our body so that we can keep going, and also happens to be a recipe for burnout.</p>

<p>When we’ve been pushing for so long, disconnected from the felt-sense of what the body needs and wants, it can be hard to find real rest, the kind that actually begins to restore a baseline of normal functioning.</p>

<h2 id="the-awe-shortcut">The Awe Shortcut</h2>

<p>In my research I’ve come to learn that awe is rather unique when it comes to human emotion. It can act as a short cut for dropping the body into a restorative, expansive state. When awe is activated our thinking mind gets quiet, creating space to reconnect to something much greater than ourselves (which happens to be really good for us).</p>

<p>Let's be clear, I'm not saying awe is a panacea that will fix everything, but it deserves some attention for at least cutting through the bullshit of our ego for a short bit of time.</p>

<p>No other emotion can do this. Most emotions can be experienced in any state our nervous system is in—restorative where we feel the fullness of an emotion without editorializing, modulated where we both feel and analyze, or dysregulated where the emotion takes over and pushes us into fight or flight mode.</p>

<p>But not awe! Awe generates a state of relaxation, an absence of thinking, and the feeling of being completely in the present moment. You cannot experience dysregulation and awe at the same time.</p>

<p>This matters because these days we’re all pretty activated by the uncertainty of the world. Our nervous systems seem perilously and persistently close to the edge, making it damn hard to find enough restoration to feel truly nourished and resourced (infinite scrolling and social media are decidedly <em>not</em> restorative activities).</p>

<p>So you can meditate a bunch, go on wellness retreats, drop yourself into a sensory deprivation tank or… just experience awe. You don’t have to go far—opening up to wonder and listening to your favorite music, spending some time in nature, or getting down with amazing art are all ways to connect with awe.</p>

<h2 id="try-it-out">Try it Out</h2>

<p>Here’s an easy one you can start doing right now: every day, for the next two weeks, commit to taking a 15 minute walk. Focus on being completely present and seeing everything “new” as if from a child’s perspective. As Kai Sky recommends, “Imagine something that gives you joy. Got it? Now go and be like that all day long. (Yes, it is that simple…).”</p>

<p>I also recorded a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Rp4nSgfWZ__tFs-aK94Vvl-caO9V4jS/view?usp=sharing">short, guided meditation</a> you can use to connect with a past experience of awe to use as a resource. Over time, the image or memory may fade, but the imprint of the somatic state will remain.</p>

        <description>
          <![CDATA[
            <p>Picture a time when someone physically grabbed you. Not necessarily in a threatening way, though these types of grabs happen too. Maybe a friend pulled you back from walking into a busy street or a colleague was trying get your attention as you walked by at a conference.</p>

<p>Do you remember what happened? How your body responded before you had a chance to think? You were probably activated in some habitual way—muscles tense, cortisol released, a little bit of a recoil as you automatically assessed the threat level.</p>

<p>Even if the person who grabbed you did it in a “friendly” way, it demanded your attention, your nervous system shifting into protective mode. You probably weren’t aware of anything else in that moment, and afterwards it might have taken you some time to return to equilibrium.</p>

<h3 id="daily-grabs">Daily Grabs</h3>

<p>Now imagine being grabbed a hundred times a day, because that's what happens! Not physically, but mentally and emotionally. Work place conflicts, news cycles, inner critics, societal expectations, uncertainty—there are so many ways we can be grabbed. And the nervous system doesn't care what the source is, so it will respond in the same way it does to a physical grab.</p>

<p>Let’s say you have an interaction with your boss that feels off. You have the thought that your boss doesn’t like you (which feels really threatening), and your body reacts—you tense up, constrict your breathing, pull away, and try and control your reaction. Which usually creates a negative feedback loop of increasing intensity—nervous system is activated, the physical sensations of discomfort become stronger, and the worry thoughts amp up.</p>

<p>What happens when this negative feedback loop continues for days, weeks, or even months? Where each day at work you are constantly on the lookout for signals of how your boss feels about you, picking apart the smallest details of a comment or obsessively comparing how your boss reacts to others in order to figure out where you stand. In this increased state of vigilance, the smallest thing can knock you over.</p>

<p>If you take this same approach in martial arts, your attacker will easily win. Your reactive state keeps you off balance and up in your head, responding from instinct while trying to “figure out” what to do.</p>

<h3 id="centering">Centering</h3>

<p>The antidote to this is centering. In the physical body, center is about two or three fingers below the belly button, and back a bit, closer to the spine. Try moving your attention there now, from your head to your physical center. Bring your breath all the way down, as if you were breathing from this place in your body. Feel what shifts.</p>

<p>You might notice some tension is released in the neck and shoulders. Or you might feel more of your legs. Maybe your peripheral vision widens, or you feel a little more connected to yourself, more present.</p>

<p>Centering doesn’t keep the grabs from happening, but it helps us see them coming. And when we can see them, we have choice in how we respond. We can choose not to engage, we can blend with the energy and move it another direction, we can block and counter attack—from a centered place the options are plenty.</p>

<p>This applies equally in the boardroom as it does on the mat. Centering helps us be more rooted, open, and responsive. And the more familiar we are with center, the easier it is to come back to it when something pulls us away.</p>

<p>Centering keeps us balanced under pressure. Think of a recent meeting you’ve been in, one that was challenging in some way or another. Your awareness was probably concentrated in your upper body from the shoulders on up. You might have noticed some tension, and that your thoughts were focused on the exchange of words, or on crafting your own verbal response. As the meeting progressed, it might have felt more and more adversarial.</p>

<p>We aren’t balanced when we center in the head. Centering from the body reminds us that interactions don’t just happen with words, but between bodies. When we shift attention to our belly center, physical tension is released, breathing deepens, and the nervous system settles. This changes how we speak, listen, and act, leading to new outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="try-it-out">Try It Out</h3>

<p>Place your hands, one on top of the other, about three fingers below your belly button. Take three slow breaths, imagining each inhale traveling all the way down to fill the space under your lower hand. As you exhale, let your shoulders drop and soften.</p>

<p>Notice what shifts—perhaps your jaw unclenches, your vision widens, or you simply feel more present in your body.</p>

<p>This same practice works beautifully in meetings. When you feel that familiar “grab”—an unexpected question, pushback on your idea, or tension in the room—take a moment to breathe into your center. You don’t need to close your eyes or make it obvious.</p>

<p>Simply shift your attention from your racing thoughts down to that steady place in your belly.</p>

<p>From there, you might find yourself listening more deeply, speaking with more clarity, or discovering a response you couldn’t access when you were centered in your head.</p>

<p>Keep practicing this during the week, especially in calm moments. The more you experience center, the easier it is to come back to it when something tries to grab you.</p>

        <title>Unbundling Leadership</title>
        <link>https://methodandmatter.com//words-make-worlds/unbundling-leadership/</link>

        <description>
          <![CDATA[
            <p>Unbundling is a business strategy that seeks to take things apart with the purpose of creating a more functional or competitive business. GE, under Jack Welch, spun off or sold underperforming business units in order to focus on the most profitable divisions, Craigslist unbundled classified ad revenue from traditional newspapers, and the shift to digital distribution unbundled songs from an album in the form of MP3s.</p>

<p>Leadership strikes me as something else that could benefit from unbundling. Not as a theoretical term, but as the practical application of what happens when someone steps into a formal leadership role. By this I mean a role that, in addition to vision and influence, comes with positional power, responsibility for a team and/or function, and possibly P&amp;L responsibilities.</p>

<p>When you step into a leadership role you’re often expected to get on with the work without much guidance or training. The new responsibilities, relationships, and altitude you need to think at are at best loosely defined in a career matrix, but more commonly have to be inferred from the organizational environment.</p>

<p>Faced with this murkiness, leaders take a number of approaches—mirroring the leaders around them, becoming the type of leader they always wanted but never had, or staying heads down and focusing on the work.</p>

<p>What I wish I had known, when I stepped into my first leadership role, is that leadership is a bundle of three different and somewhat distinct areas of responsibility: holding and communicating the vision, running the business, and developing talent. Each corresponds to a different role: leader, manager, and coach. While in practice the three blend together, it can be helpful to understand the distinct configuration of each.</p>

<h2 id="leader">Leader</h2>
<p>Leadership is the embodiment of vision and values in action. Leaders connect people to purpose, make meaning of challenges, and inspire collective movement towards shared goals. The mindset of a leader is oriented towards the future, possibility, and innovation.</p>

<p>Key responsibilities include creating and communicating the vision, aligning efforts with core values, listening to what is happening in organization, helping people understand the “why”, and showing how individual and team work contributes to larger organizational goals.</p>

<p>Leaders must do this both for the people on the team/function/department they are in charge of, and also for their colleagues across the organization. They are responsible for making sure that the work they are responsible for is understood across the company and <em>why</em> it matters in the first place.</p>

<h3 id="reflection-questions">Reflection questions:</h3>

<h4 id="vision--purpose">Vision &amp; Purpose:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How effectively am I translating abstract vision into concrete, relatable terms for my team?</li>
  <li>What stories am I telling that help people see themselves in our shared future?</li>
  <li>Does our vision still resonates with the team's evolving needs?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="influence--inspiration">Influence &amp; Inspiration:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Am I modeling the behaviors and values I want to see in others?</li>
  <li>How do I respond when my vision meets resistance or skepticism?</li>
  <li>What legacy am I creating through my leadership decisions?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="organizational-impact">Organizational Impact:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How well do I understand the broader ecosystem my team operates within?</li>
  <li>Where might I be inadvertently creating silos or barriers to collaboration?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="manager">Manager</h2>
<p>Management is the practice of running a business—orchestrating work systems and processes to achieve predictable outcomes. The mindset of a manager orients towards operational excellence and structured thinking.</p>

<p>Key responsibilities include setting clear expectations in the form of shared agreements, establishing effective processes, identifying metrics of success, ensuring efficient resource allocation, and maintaining stability and consistency.</p>

<p>It is worthwhile to note that the role of manager and leader can often be at odds. While the role of leader orients towards new possibilities through innovation, the role of manager is focused on healthy and repeatable processes. Leadership can be a destabilizing threat to management predictability.</p>

<h3 id="reflection-questions-1">Reflection Questions:</h3>

<h4 id="systems--processes">Systems &amp; Processes:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>What friction points are slowing down our team’s ability to deliver results?</li>
  <li>How do I balance standardization with the need for flexibility?</li>
  <li>Which meetings, reports, or processes could we eliminate without losing value?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="performance--accountability">Performance &amp; Accountability:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How quickly do I address performance gaps when they arise?</li>
  <li>Am I giving people the tools and resources they need to succeed?</li>
  <li>What would happen if I wasn't here for a week—would things run smoothly?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="resource-optimization">Resource Optimization:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Where am I over-investing or under-investing our team’s time and energy?</li>
  <li>How effectively am I protecting my team from organizational noise and distractions?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="coach">Coach</h2>
<p>Coaching is way of developing talent by supporting people to achieve the results they want through self-awareness and behavior change. The mindset of a coach is one of curiosity and learning, a willingness to let go of knowing the answer and trust that each person has the capacity to figure out their own path forward.</p>

<p>Key responsibilities for the coaching role cover creating space for reflection, asking powerful questions, supporting others to connect with their inner wisdom, and expanding how people observe and understand the situations they find themselves in.</p>

<p>Mentorship also falls under the umbrella of coaching. The way I distinguish between the two is that coaching is designed to connect someone to their own inner knowing with support from the coach in the form of questions and observations, while mentorship is oriented around a more senior person sharing insights from hard-won experience in order to help a more junior person grow.</p>

<h3 id="reflection-questions-2">Reflection Questions:</h3>

<h4 id="development--growth">Development &amp; Growth:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>What assumptions am I making about what each person needs to grow?</li>
  <li>How often do I ask “What do you think?” before offering my own perspective?</li>
  <li>When have I seen someone surprise themselves with their own capability?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="creating-safety">Creating Safety:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How comfortable do people feel bringing me problems or admitting mistakes?</li>
  <li>What signals might I be sending that discourage open dialogue?</li>
  <li>How do I respond when someone's approach differs from what I would do?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="letting-go">Letting Go:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Where am I solving problems that others could solve themselves?</li>
  <li>How do I distinguish between when to step in and when to step back?</li>
  <li>What would it look like to be less helpful in service of others’ growth?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>It is important to note that within each of these roles there is a wide range of variability. How you lead, manage, and coach will be shaped by your experiences, values, and beliefs about how good work gets done (and what qualifies as good work in the first place</p>

<p>Give it a try this week—track each of your days and see where you lead, manage, and coach. You might find one role is more comfortable you or that certain contexts require one role over the others. There is no one right way, but I hope that unbundling these three roles gives you useful insight to be more impactful as a leader.</p>
