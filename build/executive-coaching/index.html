    <h1>Executive and Leadership Coaching</h1> <p>Your leadership journey is unique, but it doesn't have to be lonely. Whether you are feeling stuck, challenged, or simply ready to supercharge your leadership, working with a coach&mdash;a trusted partner and loyal ally&mdash;can open up new worlds of possibility, effectiveness, and impact.</p>

      <p>Andi helped me navigate major life changes that affected my career in a big way. I grew tremendously as a person, and became far more self-aware, with her trustworthy, empathetic, and effective guidance. She helped me examine and understand my drivers  and impulses more clearly — both the ones that helped make me successful and the ones that were arguably holding me back. I walked away from every session having learned something and ready to try new approaches.</p>

    <h3>People often come to coaching when they sense a call for transformation&mdash;whether it's achieving audacious goals or working through a persistent stuckness. More often than not, these are two faces of the same invitation to see and be differently in the world.</h3>

    <p>We start with where you are and look at where you long to be. I see us as partners in this exploration, but you are always in the driver's seat. My role is to help you notice what has become invisible through familiarity&mdash;both the deep grooves of limiting beliefs and the hidden wisdom that already lives in you. Through examining how you interpret and respond to the world, we'll uncover not just who you are today, but who you are becoming. This becoming serves your values, your fullest expression, and the wider systems you're part of.</p>

    <p>The challenges of leadership often reveal deeper questions about how we might work and live differently in these complex times. Together we'll explore both the external and internal landscapes, unlocking new capacities for attention and awareness. Common areas we might explore include:</p>

    <p>

        </ul>

    <p>With some clients, I also do 360s and observe them in meetings to ground our work in observable assessments. This feedback can reveal important patterns and priorities.</p>

    <p>The challenges and opportunities you face at work can be doorways to deeper awareness&mdash;not just of self, but of the living systems we're all part of. This awareness forms the foundation for a different kind of leadership, one that can navigate complexity while staying connected to what matters most. By connecting to your innate resourcefulness and creativity through mind, heart, and body, you'll discover new ways to sense, respond, and participate in our rapidly changing world.</p>
