    <h1>Executive and Leadership Coaching</h1>
    <p>Executive coaching is a partnership designed to help you become the leader you were meant to be. Through deep inner work and practical experiments, you’ll release old patterns that limit you and step fully into your authentic leadership power.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <blockquote>
      <p>Andi helped me navigate major life changes that affected my career in a big way. I grew tremendously as a person, and became far more self-aware, with her trustworthy, empathetic, and effective guidance. She helped me examine and understand my drivers  and impulses more clearly — both the ones that helped make me successful and the ones that were arguably holding me back. I walked away from every session having learned something and ready to try new approaches.</p>

      <p>&ndash; Chief Product Officer</p>
    </blockquote>

    <hr />

    <p>I coach senior leaders who are facing a challenge they haven't been able to resolve on their own, or who are looking for more fulfillment and satisfaction in their career. For many leaders, this also means reclaiming parts of themselves that, for whatever reason, have been stuffed away.</p>

    <p>Common coaching topics that I support people with include managing key relationships, improving team dynamics (I also <a href="/team-coaching/">coach teams</a>), shaping organizational culture, having difficult conversations that aren't draining, developing talent through coaching, transitions (in role, seniority, career, and life), and more consistent self-care.</p>

    <p>This work is built on a foundation of wholeness, self-compassion, and awareness. To become the leader you want to be is an act of coming home to yourself, accepting everything that you are, and releasing old patterns that have been holding you back.</p>

    <p>What this looks like in practice:</p>

    <h3>1. Welcome Everything</h3>
    <p>Fully accepting who you are—with love and compassion—is the foundation of transformative leadership. This means embracing even the parts you’ve learned to hide or deny.</p>

    <p>When you welcome all aspects of yourself you have access to every facet of who you are. You mind, emotions, intuition, and your body’s wisdom work together as a whole. The anxious achiever, the harsh inner critic, the visionary dreamer—they all belong but they no longer overwhelm you. Instead of being run by whatever part is loudest or most triggered in the moment, you have access to everything and can respond from choice.</p>

    <h3>2. Liberation from the Past</h3>
    <p>We all bring our family dynamics and old relationship patterns into work. Maybe you had a critical parent and now you can’t delegate because nothing anyone does is good enough. Or you avoid conflict because anger wasn’t safe growing up. These patterns run the show until you begin the inner work of awareness, welcoming, and acceptance.</p>

    <p>As your patterns relax, you begin to see them for what they are—old survival strategies that no longer serve you. You begin to respond to what’s actually happening instead of what your nervous system thinks is happening based on the past. Your inner critic loses its power. The stories about who you should be fall away, and you find the ground to just be who you are.</p>

    <h3>3. Wholeness And Choice</h3>
    <p>When all parts of you are welcome and working together you experience wholeness. But being whole doesn’t mean sharing everything with everyone. That’s not leadership, that’s a lack of boundaries.</p>

    <p>Wholeness gives you the choice of what to express based on what’s needed. In a strategy meeting, you might lean into your analytical strengths. When a team member is struggling, you draw on your compassion. With a difficult stakeholder, maybe you need your firm, boundaried self. All of these are authentically you. The difference is you’re choosing consciously rather than hiding parts of yourself because you think they're not “leader-like” or professional enough.</p>

    <h3>4. Leadership Work = Relationship Work</h3>
    <p>Every leadership challenge is fundamentally about relationships. That difficult team member? Relationship work. The project that’s stuck? Usually comes down to trust and communication between people. Your ability to influence and inspire? All relationships.</p>

    <p>When you lead from wholeness instead of some idealized image of what a leader should be, everything shifts. People can feel the difference. They trust you because you’re real. Collaboration becomes natural because there's actual connection. Skills like delegation and difficult conversations stop being things you have to psych yourself up for—they become natural extensions of how you relate. You listen differently too, hearing not just words but what really matters to people.</p>

    <h3>5. Transformation and Embodied Practice</h3>

    <p>You can’t think your way through this work. Real change happens through the body by trying out experiments and building consistent and intetional practices.</p>

    <p>Experiments are a chance to test things out and see what happens. Maybe you try pausing before responding to criticism instead of immediately defending yourself. Or you practice saying “I don't know” in a meeting instead of pretending you have all the answers. Small things. You pay attention to what happens—how it feels in your body, how others respond, what shifts in the dynamic. Then you adjust and try again.</p>

    <p>We’re always practicing something, whether we realize it or not. Every time you interrupt someone in a meeting, you’re practicing impatience. Every time you avoid a difficult conversation, you’re practicing conflict avoidance. The question is whether you’re reinforcing old patterns or intentionally building new ones.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>When these principles move from concepts to lived experience, something shifts. Your leadership challenges don’t disappear—but they transform from problems that overwhelm you into puzzles that intrigue you. The impossible conversation becomes an opportunity for deeper connection. The team that drives you crazy becomes a mirror for your own growth edges. The strategic dilemma that kept you up at night reveals surprising solutions when you approach it from wholeness rather than fear.</p>

    <p>You’ll find yourself responding rather than reacting. Making decisions from clarity rather than shoulds. Building trust without trying so hard. The skills you’ve always relied on—your analytical brilliance, your drive, your vision—are still there, but now they’re integrated with emotional intelligence, somatic wisdom, and relational depth. You become the kind of leader people want to follow not because you have all the answers, but because you’re fully, authentically present.</p>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>The investment for a six month engagement with 60 minute bi-weekly sessions ranges from $7200 to $15400 USD, depending on role, organizational maturity, team size, and complexity. I can invoice everything up front or bill on a quarterly or monthly cadence.</p>

    <h2>Single Session Alternative</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>For some folks, a six month engagement isn’t what is needed.</p>

    <p>If you have a particular issue, challenge, or opportunity you’d like coaching on, I offer a single session option.</p>

    <p>I’ll send you a kickoff questionairre to fill out with as much information as you can, and then we’ll meet for two hours for an in-depth coaching session. Afterwards you’ll receive a recording of the video, additional resources, and a set of action items to move forward with.</p>

    <p>The cost is $750 - $1250 for this session.</p>
