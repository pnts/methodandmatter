    <h1>How I Work</h1>
    <p>Time is our most precious resource. I hold mine with great intention, protecting the space needed for presence, deep work, and meaningful connection. This document describes how this shapes my availability and communication.</p>

    <h3>A Foundation of Presence</h3>

    <p>Transformation emerges from radical presence. This truth guides how I structure my days and engage with others. Each moment holds the possibility for deep connection and discovery, but only if we create the conditions for presence to flourish.</p>

    <h3>Time and Energy</h3>

    <p>Based in San Francisco, I arrange my days to honor the depth each engagement requires. This means dedicated days for deep work, a maximum of three client sessions per day, and deliberate space between commitments. My practices of meditation, movement, and time in nature create the foundation that enables full presence in every interaction.</p>

    <h3>Availability<h3>

    <p>All meetings are scheduled with advanced notice. I do most of my scheduling through Calendly.</p>

    <p>I work with clients Monday-Thursday from 8am-4pm Pacific Time on alternating weeks.</p>

    <p>Every three months I take a mini-sabbatical for two weeks, which allows me to create space for deep, focused work in service of <a href="/the-becoming/">the becoming</a>.</p>

    <h3>Reaching Out</h3>

    <p>Initial contact happens through my <a href="/conversation/">inquiry form</a>. This helps me understand your needs and respond appropriately. For coaching inquiries, I respond within 48 hours. For other types of inquiries, my response time varies but I aim to respond withint 2-3 working days.</p>

    <p>Fellow practitioners, researchers, and curious minds interested in connecting can reach out on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mignolo/">LinkedIn</a>‚Äîplease include a note that helps me understand the context for connecting.</p>

    <p>While I do maintain Slack and Discord accounts for various communities, I do not check these at a regular cadence. Sometimes check them as little as once a month (or longer!). Email is the best way to contact me.</p>

    <h3>Communication Rhythms</h3>

    <p>I check email two times a day‚Äîin the morning and in the late afternoon‚Äîin order to protect my time and energy, and to maintain the presence and attention my work requires.</p>

    <p>Current clients receive responses and session notes within 48 hours, with additional support available via text and WhatsApp. For other inquiries, my response time will vary depending on my current commitments.</p>

    <p>If you need to reschedule or cancel a session within 24 hours of the start time, please send me a text. If this is the first time you are making an last-minute change, rescheduling will be accommodated. If this is not the first time, your session will be considered "complete" and you will need to schedule a subsequent session.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your patience with response times. This structure enables me to show up fully for the work that matters most.</p>
