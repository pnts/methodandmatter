    <h1>Leadership Programs</h1>
    <p>Multi-week experiential programs designed in partnership with you, built around what your leaders actually need.</p>

    <h2>How it Works</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <h3>Your leaders are capable—they get results, solve problems, keep projects on track.</h3>

    <p>But the way they are getting those results is starting to have a negative impact: burning out their teams, leaning too hard on a few key people, or avoiding difficult conversations that need to happen. Or maybe they're excellent in their domain but can't quite think systemically enough to step into the bigger strategic questions their role requires.</p>

    <p>You’ve probably tried various trainings—workshops on communication, courses on emotional intelligence, sessions on strategic thinking. People leave energized, full of new ideas, and within weeks everything reverts. Most training programs deliver content while skipping the conditions for actual development. Everything stays in the head.</p>

    <p><strong>Real development requires experience, time, and practice.</strong></p>

    <p>We start by understanding what's actually happening with your leaders and your organization—interviews with team members, looking at patterns, paying attention to what's working and where things get stuck. Then we design a multi-week program (typically 4-6 weeks) that creates the experiences your leaders need to develop new capacities.</p>

    <p><strong>These programs are grounded in experiential learning.</strong> We work with rigorous models and frameworks in service of direct experience. Participants practice in pairs and small groups, try things in their bodies, reflect on what's emerging, take experiments back into their actual work. Between sessions they integrate, notice what's shifting, build new habits.</p>

    <p><strong>This work develops leadership capacity—the inner resources that allow leaders to show up differently, stay present under pressure, build genuine relationships, and to hold complexity.</strong></p>

    <h2>Why work with me?</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>I spent over a decade in executive leadership building teams and navigating organizational complexity. I know what works when you're leading through real challenges because I've done it, made the mistakes, learned what matters.</p>

    <p>I'm a Professional Certified Coach with the International Coaching Federation, with training in coaching methodologies that focus on adult development and how people actually change. I've designed and delivered leadership programs for organizations across different industries, working with hundreds of leaders at different levels and functions.</p>

    <p>These programs engage the whole person—cognitive understanding, emotional awareness, embodied practice. I trust that leaders have their own wisdom and my role is creating conditions where that wisdom can emerge and develop.</p>

    <h2>Program Examples</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>Past programs, which tend to run 4 - 6 weeks, have focused on areas like:</p>

    <ul class="bullets">
      <li><strong>Self as Leader</strong>—Developing presence and awareness as leadership tools. Learning to recognize and release habitual patterns, stay resourced under pressure, and increase the capacity for creative response.</li>
      <li><strong>Leader as Coach</strong>—Building a coaching approach to leadership. Learning to develop others through powerful questions, deep listening, and genuine curiosity. <a href="/leader-as-coach/">Learn more</a></li>
      <li><strong>Leading Through Change</strong>—Developing the capacity to navigate uncertainty, hold complexity, and support teams through transition.</li>
      <li><strong>Building Team Culture</strong>—Understanding how culture forms, how to work with it intentionally, how to create conditions for trust and collaboration.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Programs are custom designed based on your organizational context, leadership challenges, and development goals.</p>
