    <h2>Why This Workshop?</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>You’re exhausted. The kind of tired that a long weekend or a vacation can’t fix. You come back, and within days (or hours), you’re right back where you started.</p>

    <p>What most leaders don’t realize is that rest is a skill. And most of us were never taught how to do it.</p>

    <p>We think rest means doing nothing—collapsing on the couch, scrolling through our phones, or trying to quiet our minds while they race through tomorrow’s meetings. But rest is something more specific, rooted in how your nervous system actually works.</p>

    <p>This course teaches you what rest actually is, why it matters, and how to practice it.
This course teaches you what rest actually is, why it matters, and how to practice it. You'll build a foundation for genuine restoration that becomes a resource you can access whenever you need it.</p>

    <h2>Who this is for</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>This course is for leaders who are tired-the kind of tired that doesn't go away with a good night's sleep or a long weekend.</p>

    <p>You might be someone who:</p>

    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Feels like you're always "on" and can't seem to fully settle, even when you have downtime</li>
      <li>Returns from vacation feeling briefly refreshed, only to be exhausted again within days</li>
      <li>Knows you need to take better care of yourself but isn't sure what that actually means</li>
      <li>Feels the early signs of burnout and wants to build resilience before things get worse</li>
      <li>Has tried meditation or relaxation techniques but struggles to make them stick</li>
    </ul>

      <p>This course is designed for leaders who want practical, science-based approaches to working with stress and building genuine capacity for restoration.</p>

    <h2>What you can expect</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>This is a six-week course that meets once a week for 90 minutes. Each session includes teaching, guided practice, and time for reflection and questions.</p>

    <p>You'll learn the foundational elements of restorative practice-body sensing, breath awareness, working with emotions and thoughts-and build them progressively over the six weeks. Each week introduces new elements while reinforcing what you've already learned.</p>

    <p>The practices themselves are done lying down or in a comfortable seated position. You're guided through the entire experience, so there's no need to "get it right" or achieve a particular state. The work is about noticing, welcoming what's present, and allowing your nervous system to find its own path to restoration.</p>

    <p>Between sessions, you'll have short practices to do on your own to help you begin integrating what you're learning into your daily life.</p>

    <p>By the end of the course, you'll have a clear understanding of how rest actually works in your body and a practice you can return to whenever you need it.</p>
