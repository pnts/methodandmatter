    <img src="/images/amignolo-profile-web-square.jpg" class="bio" alt="" />

    <p>Over the last two decades I've had a pretty winding career path: testing video games, overseeing the digital side of Free Speech TV, teaching business English in Japan, and building product at multiple tech start-ups with two exits and one currently at unicorn status. Since 2020 I've been an executive coach working with unconventional leaders and teams including non-founder executives, global management teams, and emerging leaders.</p>

    <p>I work one-on-one with clients, coach executive teams, run group coaching programs, and design leadership development curriculum for organizations.</p>

    <p>I write a monthly newsletter called <a href="/kitchen-party/">Kitchen Party</a> that explores the intersection of leadership, business, psychology, and design. I'm also the President of the <a href="https://ixda.org/">Interaction Design Association</a> and run an experimental ontological design studio, <a href="https://pnts.us/">P N T S . U S</a>.</p>

    <p>Outside of coaching I am a <a href="https://realizationprocess.org">dedicated meditator</a>, <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/camping/backcountry-camping.htm">avid backcountry camper</a>, and <a href="https://plumblossom.net/ChoyLiFut/">budding martial artist</a>.</p>

    <p>I reside on the unceded ancestral homeland of the <a href="https://www.ramaytush.org">Ramaytush Ohlone</a> peoples who are the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula.

      <p>Whenever there is a house party people inevitably gather in the kitchen, convivially packed together with warmth and openness. The environment encourages the sharing of ideas, possibilities, and dreams, subtly connecting and altering all who are present. <a href="/kitchen-party/">Kitchen Party</a> is a newsletter built with this ethos in mind, inviting explorations at the intersection of leadership, business, psychology, and design. </p>
