    <h2>Hi, I'm Andrea.</h2>

    <p>I founded method & matter because I believe in leaders like you. Leaders that don't necessarily "look" like the dominant leadership archetype. My personal leadership journey was fraught with doubt, derision, and failures as I struggled to find a way of leading that was aligned with my values and vision. With the guidance of an executive coach, I began a journey of unwinding beliefs that no longer served me, while cultivating a connection with my power, purpose, and embodied leadership.</p>

    <p>The work was nothing less than transformational. And I want this for you, too.  </p>

    <p>Before becoming a coach I lead product and design teams for startups in the B2B SaaS space, and before that I taught business English in Japan for four years. I'm currently the President of the <a href="https://ixda.org">Interaction Design Association</a>, have an MBA from the  <a href="https://weatherhead.case.edu">Weatherhead School of Management</a>, a BA in Technocultural Studies from <a href="https://oberlin.edu">Oberlin College</a>, and am certified through <a href="https://newventureswest.com">New Ventures West</a>, <a href="https://coachingfederation.org/">The International Coaching Federation</a>, and the <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/">Enneagram Institute</a>.

    <p><strong>Land Acknowledgement:</strong> I reside on the unceded ancestral homeland of the <a href="https://www.ramaytush.org">Ramaytush Ohlone</a> peoples who are the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula. With deepest respect to the Ancestors, Elders and Relatives of the Ramaytush Community, I affirm their sovereign rights as First Peoples. I am committed to dismantling ongoing legacies of settler colonialism and white supremacy through study, service, donations, Yunakin Land Tax, and my own inner-work. </p>

    <h2>Why method & matter?</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>I am passionate about working with people who are committed to creative ways of leading (and living) in this volatile and uncertain world. People who know there are better ways, who are bravely leading in the face of adversity, whose unique leadership archetype is desperately needed in this world. People who are determined to build a better future, who have hope, who refuse to give up. People who sense that their own transformation is the key to unlocking their wildest dreams, their teams, their companies, and their world.</p>

    <p>I believe that personal transformation is the foundation for meaningful change. By starting with ourselves we can examine ingrained patterns of communicating, responding, and collaborating. As we start to understand and shift our patterns we experience new possibilities for how we show up, and in these possibilities are the seeds of larger change.</p>
