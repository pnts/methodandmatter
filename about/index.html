    <p>I founded method & matter because I believe in leaders like you. Leaders that don't necessarily "look" like the dominant leadership archetype. My personal leadership journey was fraught with doubt, derision, and failures as I struggled to find a way of leading that was aligned with my values and vision. With the guidance of an executive coach, I began a journey of unwinding beliefs that no longer served me, while cultivating a connection with my power, purpose, and leadership embodiment.</p>

    <p>The work was nothing less than transformational. And I want this for you, too.  </p>

    <p>Before becoming a coach I lead product and design teams for startups in the B2B SaaS space, and before that I taught business English in Japan for four years. I'm currently the Vice President of the Interaction Design Association, have an MBA from the <a href="https://weatherhead.case.edu">Weatherhead School of Management</a>, a BA in Technocultural Studies from <a href="https://oberlin.edu">Oberlin College</a>, and am a certified Integral Coach through <a href="https://www.newventureswest.com">New Ventures West</a>.

    <h2>Why method & matter?</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>I am passionate about working with people who are committed to creative ways of leading (and living) in this volatile and uncertain world. People who know there are better ways, who are bravely leading in the face of adversity, whose unique leadership archetype is desperately needed in this world. People who are determined to build a better future, who have hope, who refuse to give up. People who sense that their own transformation is the key to unlocking their wildest dreams, their teams, their companies, and their world.</p>

    <p>I believe that personal transformation is the foundation for meaningful change. By starting with ourselves we can examine ingrained patterns of communicating, responding, and collaborating. As we start to understand and shift our patterns we experience new possibilities for how we show up, and in these possibilities are the seeds of larger change.</p>
