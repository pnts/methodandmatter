						<p>I can feel the days getting shorter as we creep into fall but we're not there yet! San Francisco has delivered a burst of beautiful (and warm) weather that I am enjoying alongside a sweet pitbull who is visiting for the week. I'm Andi, this is the becoming, and welcome to August's missive.</p>

<h3 id="the-paradox-of-why">The Paradox of Why</h3>

<p>I’ve been sitting with some BIG unknowing this month and wondering how best to tend to this specific state of being. How to stay connected with the felt sense of… being reorganized on a molecular level is probably the best way to put it, and how to maintain an open connection to the process of transformation. In working with dreams the dreamer is encouraged to presence the dream, to be with the landscapes, beings, and animals as alive and vibrant as they were when initial contact was made in the dreamworld. The worst thing you can do with dreams is to analyze them, zapping them of their vitality and reducing them to static, singular messages. I think the same goes for being in connection with the unknown in a way that feels nourishing and supportive. Where the textured complexity of the world hums its aliveness, rather than being reduced to the silence of flat, smooth surfaces. And I’ve come to realize that one of the primary ways to sever this connection, that can reduce the beautiful complexity of unknowing to a lifeless morass, is the seemly simple ‘why?’ question.</p>

<p>Sidenote: I apologize for the clunkiness of the ‘why?’ and ‘why’ in quotation marks throughout this piece, but I think (hope) it brings clarity to the reading experience.</p>

<p class="archive-notice">This is an archived version of <strong>the becoming</strong>. You can sign up to receive future editions using the form at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/why#etymonline_v_7987">etymology of the word why</a> comes from the Old English <em>hwi</em> to indicate for what purpose or by what means. I’m sure in olden times it was an innocuous word but I can’t help but read it in a voice that demands <em>justification</em> for whatever (or whomever) is on the receiving end of <em>hwi</em>.</p>

<p>Of course it’s vitally important to understand the why of things, but paradoxically asking why questions doesn’t really get us to what we want to know. ‘Why?’ closes the aperture of our perception instead of opening it to the complexity, wonder, and awe required to behold and understand something like purpose.</p>

<p>‘Why?’ is a shorthand invocation that points to something and asks, “what is the reason for this to be the way it is?” The question and intention itself may be well and good, but the response often falls short of the meaning we seek. Think back to the last time you asked a why question. Something like, “Why did you do that?” Or “Why not try this instead?” Did you learn the real purpose and get the clarity you were looking for? Or did something else happen that impacted the dynamics of the relationship? Maybe one or both of you ended up feeling a little defensive.</p>

<p>‘Why?’ is like dropping a small turd into the middle of a conversation. The receiver feels offended and the questioner becomes both embarrassed and defensive, startled by the not so favorable reaction of the receiver. Frustratingly neither person is closer to understanding than before.</p>

<p>Because here is the thing: ‘why?’ takes us out of direct experience and moves us into an analytical mode. We don’t answer from direct experience and what is happening in the moment, instead we remove ourselves from what we are in contact with in order to attempt root-cause analysis in the midst of complexity. And the moment we make this move we lose contact with the layered richness of experience through a reductive act of cause and effect.</p>

<p>We are <em>notoriously bad</em> at using logic to figure out what we’re really up to in the world, we can’t analytically trace a chain of events to a single cause (and also half of our motivations exist below the level of consciousness). Maybe I did the thing you are asking about because of something that happened to me 10 years ago that is subconsciously influencing my behavior in certain situations.</p>

<p>‘Why?’ as a <em>question</em> is causal. ‘Why’ as an <em>understanding</em> is systemic. But we can’t get to systemic understandings by asking causal questions (if only that shortcut worked). We have to do the heavy lifting of critical thinking and deep inquiry to get there.</p>

<p>To be clear I’m not advocating to remove the word from circulation! It would be impossible to eliminate ‘why?’ from the mouths of every 3 year old on the planet, and ‘why?’ has some use in scientific and process oriented endeavors. But more often than not, ‘why?’ diverts us from the reflective rigor needed to understand what it is we really want to know.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how ‘why?’ behaves in fact-based situations with the age old favorite, “Why is the sky blue?”</p>

<p>Light waves from the sun hit our atmosphere. Certain wavelengths pass through while others - blue and violet - are <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-the-sky-blue/">scattered by the gases and particles</a> in the air, which is why the sky is blue on a sunny day. But the sky is also blue because of the <a href="http://www.atmo.arizona.edu/students/courselinks/fall12/atmo170a1s1/lecture_notes/scattering/why_not_violet.html">physiology of the human eye</a> and the particular wavelengths of light they are able to receive. <em>Two</em> wavelengths are scattered, blue and violet, but our eyes are more sensitive to blue than violet. So the sky isn’t really blue at all, it just appears blue to us. There is an interplay between physics and physiology, between observer and observed, so that the world is never quite as we think it is.</p>

<p>Curiosity is a beautiful human trait and ‘why?’ is the delivery mechanism of choice for small children learning about the world. But for adults, outside of certain circumstances, why is a knee-jerk reaction - a quick formulation of a question that hasn’t been given enough time to be understood and formed with the right words. The desire to know is present, to understand the purpose or reason, but asking ‘why?’ doesn’t get us to a core cause of human behavior or the mysterious ‘why’ of the emergent world.</p>

<p>‘Why?’ is complex and defined by the relationship between observer and observed. If you really tend to your wondering you’ll probably arrive at a more rigorous question along the lines of, “What causes the sky to appear blue <em>to us</em>?” And after you have formed this question, curiosity may lead you to wonder what color the sky is for other animals, or what color the sky is if no one is observing it. How rich the inquiry becomes! The world is not reduced to a universal maxim of The Sky Is Blue, but is revealed in its full dynamic complexity and mystery.</p>

<p>Other forms of lazy why questions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why is that important to you?</li>
  <li>Why do you like that?</li>
  <li>Why did you make that decision?</li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately, we have other interrogatives that can help us uncover ‘why’ while allowing people to stay in contact with their direct experience: who, what, when, where and the <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/10/stop-asking-why-and-start-asking-how">one h - how</a>. Eliminating ‘why’ as a question will lead you to a deeper understanding of the purpose or means of whatever it is you are curious about. For more on the specifics of how to ask questions without asking why, see Rebecca Berry’s insightful article, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-you-should-stop-asking-what-ask-instead-rebecca-berry/">Why you stop asking why (and what to ask instead)</a>.  If you are a designer looking to understand the ‘why’ and want to improve your ideation prompts, sheryl cabana has your back with, <a href="https://medium.com/artefact-stories/design-for-meaning-rethinking-designs-ideation-prompts-13fa6c02ba3c">Design for Meaning: Rethinking Design’s Ideation Prompts</a>.</p>

<p>Here are those why questions again, reworded:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What makes that important to you? What resonates most deeply for you?</li>
  <li>What do you like about that? How is that for you?</li>
  <li>What was behind that decision?</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyone who has been on the receiving end of a why question knows how judgmental they can feel. I frequently forget to turn the oven off after baking, and my boyfriend will wander in and say, “why is the oven on?”  Immediately I find myself getting a little snippy and defensive. My internal monologue goes something like, “I made cookies earlier and as I pulled the last tray out of the oven I got a phone call and that diverted my attention and because I can’t multitask I moved into that activity and left the cookie making behind and I guess I’m a terrible person. Shit, who knows, maybe it has something to do with having jaundice as a baby.” In this case a simple, “What is the oven on for?” would be great and save me from going down a rabbit hole of negative character analysis.</p>

<p>Some of you may be wondering about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys">The Five Whys</a>, a method pioneered by Toyota in the 80s. If you are analyzing a process, go for it. But if you are analyzing human behavior, try and stay away from it. Approaches like The Five Whys can be really useful when seeking to understand cause and effect in complicated systems, but when sitting in complexity where cause and effect are <em>loosely</em> correlated, asking why can take us in the wrong direction, alienate others, and ultimately fail to help us understand the very thing we are seeking clarity on.</p>

<p>Give it a try this week. Whenever you catch yourself reaching for ‘why?’ pause and think about what it is you <em>really</em> want to know. And then use a non-why interrogative instead. And I will continue to tend to the BIG unknowing that has made its way to my doorstep, allowing it to be full and mysterious by not needing to know what, exactly, is its purpose.</p>

<p>A quick update on <a href="https://maven.com/andrea-mignolo/leader-as-coach">Leader as Coach</a> - the upcoming cohort has been pushed back 2 weeks and is now starting October 2nd. For those of you who had schedule conflicts with the earlier dates, hopefully this now aligns with your schedule!

<h3 id="worth-your-attention">Worth Your Attention</h3>
<p>Neuroscientist Daniel Toker takes a look at how the theory of the triune brain - the idea that we have a lizard brain, mammalian brain, and primate/human brain - became widespread even though, from the get go, <a href="https://thebrainscientist.com/2018/04/11/you-dont-have-a-lizard-brain/">evolutionary neuroscientists had a sense that it wasn't right</a>. It's a fun read, and you don't have to hold an advanced degree to follow along.</p>

<p>Marketing is hard, and the techniques recommended by "experts" often feel manipulative and sleezy. I was complaining about this to a friend last week and he shared a resource that kinda blew my socks off - <a href="https://marketingforhippies.com">Marketing for Hippies</a>. The site is great, the copy is fun, and there are lots of free resources to get started. But the best part! The best part are the "<a href="https://marketingforhippies.com/puttering/">Putting Sessions</a>" that Tad offers. I have never seen anything quite like it and DELIGHTED is probably the best way to describe my reaction to the whole endeavor. Go read it, enjoy, maybe book a session. And feel your faith in humanity restored just a little bit more.</p>

<p>"<a href="https://nonprofitquarterly.org/healing-centered-leadership-a-path-to-transformation/">Healing-centered leadership</a> acknowledges how we all have been harmed, and focuses on restoring relationships across differences. This means that healing-centered leaders practice empathy over blame, compassion over complacency, and curiosity over criticism. The only path to reimagining the future is through healing our collective trauma and restoring a sense of possibility in our work. This can only happen when we foster a collective imagination that restores communal wisdom and sets a path toward more humane ways to show up in life." - Shawn A. Ginwright</p>

<p>Inline with the topic of this edition's essay is <a href="http://imaginaljourneying.com">Imaginal Journeying</a>, a process of staying connected to the imaginal realm typically accessed through dreams and subconscious explorations. The copy on the site states "it can open a door into a direct and intimate connection with the depths and richness of the full range of human and collective experience. This unleashes creativity, deepens emotional resonance, heals trauma, uncovers true purpose and unlocks new paradigms for people." I first started learning and working with the imaginal realms through Stephen Aizenstat's Dream Tending work, and continue to find resonance with folks who are exploring this space.</p>

If you don't have time to read the book, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pDeRAi3Ysv7AK4xax/learning-to-learn-and-navigating-moods">here are</a> a <a href="https://blas.com/learning-to-learn-moods/">few summaries</a> that are a pretty quick read and give you some useful food for thought to take into both your work and personal life.</p>

						<p>I would be remiss to not say hello for July, though this month is without a long-form essay. Not for lack of effort, but the writing hasn’t coalesced into something tangible enough to share. Which caused a mild freak-out as I contemplated the trail of <a href="https://www.pagesandplatforms.com/blog/how-to-finish-your-zero-draft">zero drafts</a> in my wake and felt the pressure of winnowing days, providing a front-row seat to how I create the drama of my life.</p>

<p>Essay aside, I have been writing up a storm this month. While the becoming’s July essay didn’t quite get there, I did post a number of articles on Medium: <a href="https://medium.com/wordsmakeworlds/the-coaching-leadership-style-developing-self-and-developing-others-2f3fd665ba6d">The Coaching Leadership Style</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/wordsmakeworlds/12-essential-books-for-leaders-who-coach-a7620fce706a">12 Essential Books for Leaders Who Coach</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/wordsmakeworlds/the-mindset-qualities-and-posture-of-a-coach-28ff82c21a21">The Mindset, Qualities, and Posture of a Coach</a>. So it’s not like I’ve been <em>slacking</em>, exactly. But I have been in more of a liminal place than I realized, coming off some deep personal work and transformational events at the end of June that continue to unravel and remake me across the arc of late summer.</p>

<h3 id="clearing">Clearing</h3>
<p>Since I don’t have a full essay to offer this month, please enjoy this poem by Martha Postlewaith that I find to be both a balm and an invocation.</p>

<p>Do not try to save<br />
the whole world<br />
or do anything grandiose.<br />
Instead, create<br />
a clearing<br />
in the dense forest<br />
of your life<br />
and wait there<br />
patiently,<br />
until the song<br />
that is your life<br />
falls into your own cupped hands<br />
and you recognize and greet it.<br />
Only then will you know<br />
how to give yourself to this world<br />
so worthy of rescue.</p>

<h3 id="new-newsletter-announcement">New Newsletter Announcement!</h3>
<p><img src="/images/og/og-words-make-worlds.png" alt="Leader as Coach announcement" /></p>

<p>A few weeks ago I launched a newsletter about the art, science, and craft of the Coaching Leadership Style. Published bi-weekly, <a href="https://methodandmatter.com/words-make-worlds/">Words Make Worlds</a> offers practical insights, exercises, and reflection prompts for folks who want to integrate coaching skills into their leadership practice. Developing and facilitating <a href="https://methodandmatter.com/leader-as-coach">Leader as Coach</a> has been tremendously rewarding and I wanted to find a way to get some of the material out to folks who are interested but cannot, for whatever reason, enroll in the live course.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="leader-as-coach-updates">Leader as Coach Updates</h3>
<p><img src="/images/og/leader-as-coach-2.png" alt="Leader as Coach announcement" /></p>

<p>Speaking of which, Leader as Coach is now a 6 week course! After running three incredible pilots in the spring, I took the summer to integrate the feedback and overhaul the program. The new version kicks off in September and you can <a href="https://maven.com/andrea-mignolo/leader-as-coach">read more about it on Maven</a>, or reach out if you have any questions!</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="tent-talks-the-coaching-leadership-style">Tent Talks: The Coaching Leadership Style</h3>
<p>If you happen to be around tomorrow (Tuesday, August 1st) I’m giving a short <a href="https://chicagocamps.org/event/andrea-mignolo-getting-started-in-the-coaching-leadership-style/">Tent Talk about the Coaching Leadership Style</a>. The talk will be recorded so if you can’t make it I’ll share the video out in next month’s newsletter.</p>

<h3 id="worth-your-attention">Worth Your Attention</h3>

<p>“<em>The times that I have known most deeply what is true and beautiful and important — when I understand how all of the little things are connected to the overwhelmingness of being — have been the times in which I forget the demands of a self.</em>” <a href="https://one.compost.digital/the-salt-of-the-cosmos/">Tal Milovina’s beautiful meditation</a> on the ouroboros of ontological design defies easy categorization (other than “this is a piece you <em>must</em> read”). Weaving between physical and digital realms, being and nothingness, scientific rationalism and deeply human feeling states, pathology and ways of being, Milovina’s insights are connected through the semiotics of lithium, an unexpected and poignant representation of this particular moment in global time.</p>

<p>What do you get when you combine the daughter of a comedy writer with non-dual experience? The inimitable Jean Houston. This short talk, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlRJTvm2eWY">The Quest for Nondual Reality</a>” touches on a non-dual developmental path for self and world, one that illuminates the interconnection and evolution of everything with everything else. As I deepen in my own nondual work through <a href="https://realizationprocess.org">The Realization Process</a> (something I will be talking about more soon) I am researching ways in which people give language to nondual experiences in order to find my own place as a guide and teacher of nondual practices.</p>

<p>Speaking of comedy, amazing human Viktor Frankel uses it to great effect in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD1512_XJEw&amp;t=11s">short clip on humanity’s search for meaning</a> from a lecture in 1972. If you don’t watch the video, remember this quote from Goethe that Frankl invokes, "<em>We have to be idealists, in a way, because then we'll wind up as the true, the real realists. If we take Man as he his we make him worse but if we take man as he should be, we make him capable of becoming what he can be.</em>”</p>

<p>Creating a world where everyone belongs is <a href="https://www.buildingbelonging.us">Brian Stout’s mission</a>. I met Brian in the summer of 2021 at the <a href="https://strozziinstitute.com">Strozzi dojo</a> in Petaluma, California and I’ve been following his work ever since. What I appreciate most about Brian’s is the transparency, detail, and <em>deep care</em> with which he writes, shares and creates. And his <a href="https://citizenstout.substack.com/p/belonging-scale-part-1">most recent post</a> on an initiative he has been co-creating, Belonging @ Scale, is no exception. Bringing new worlds into being takes a phenomenal level of effort, community, and awareness and I think you’ll get a lot from this two part series (<a href="https://citizenstout.substack.com">sign-up to his newsletter</a> to get notified when Part 2 is published!).</p>

<p>Erin Kissane is writing up a ton of insightful, critical, and spot on essays about the Fediverse, Mastodon, and community building. <a href="https://erinkissane.com/the-affordance-loop">The affordance loop</a> is one of those essays and a must read for anyone on the internet today (which means you, dear reader). Freedom, flourishing, safety, and refuge are all on the table through explorations of affordances, intention, and outcomes. This is a nuanced take on ecosystems in the throes of change, how we create networks of meaningful connection, and the way in which digital affordances, now decades in their making and maturation, shape communities and in turn are shaped by communities.</p>

<hr />

<p>Thanks for being here. I hope you are having a lovely, moderately cool, and wildfire-free summer. Or a bitingly crisp, clear, and snow-filled winter. See you in August!</p>

					<![CDATA[
						<p>Hello from the other side of summer solstice! It’s cold as f*ck here in San Francisco and accordingly foggy as well. I recently learned SF summers are colder than South African winters so that’s something. It’s fun to be bundled up in sweaters while others get to wear sun dresses (not that I'm jealous or anything). But enough with that - I’m Andi, this is <a href="https://methodandmatter.com/the-becoming">the becoming</a>, and I am glad you are here.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="/images/kp/009.jpg" alt="A San Francisco succulent" />

<h3 id="practice-and-intuition">Practice and Intuition</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>“We are what we repeatedly do.”  - Aristotle</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lately I have been thinking a lot about <em>practice</em>. Not because I thought it would be a good thing to think about, but because the word keeps showing up in my life - an email in my inbox, a course lecture, a podcast episode, a blog post, a comment in passing - enough synchronicity that I know better than to ignore it.  And so here we are with the topic of this month’s newsletter: practice.</p>

<p class="archive-notice">This is an archived version of <strong>the becoming</strong>. You can sign up to receive future editions using the form at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p>I’d like to unpack two things in what I just wrote: practice and synchronicity. Practice, as I take meaning from the conversations showing up on my doorstep, is about cultivating a feel or an at-home-ness with something new or unfamiliar. It is about the <a href="https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/fifteen-or-one-third">movement of return</a>, coming back, and <a href="https://vividvoid.substack.com/p/the-canvas">remembering</a>. This kind of practice isn’t about acquiring a new skill (e.g. learning a new language) as much as it is a kind of <a href="https://elizabethberg.substack.com/p/a-cool-summer-morning">tending to our own becoming</a>. It is practice that shifts how we are in the world and how we respond to life. These types of practices require the support of not just the mind, but the heart and body as well.</p>

<p>Over the course of 2023 I have been developing my intuitive practice - the ability to be aware of and in connection with non-rational ways of knowing. This requires a shift in how I interact with the world - from head-based thinking to more holistic, full-bodied perception. It also requires radical presence and connection with myself <em>and</em> the more-than-human world at the same time.</p>

<p>I don’t really have an answer to what this looks like, no end-game in mind, but I do have a few questions that have been guiding me. Things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is arising in this moment?</li>
  <li>Am I present enough to fully sense what is here now?</li>
  <li>How can I be in conversation with what is here now?</li>
  <li>How do I move in congruence with what I am sensing?</li>
</ul>

<p>And these questions in turn informed the design of a set of practices to keep me coming back, day in and day out, to my intuition. They helped me see the kind of body that is required to live intuitively: one that can be present and sensitive to what is arising. And once this became clear I created practices to deepen my capacity to be present and sensing. Which included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Daily meditations the lineage of the Realization Process (an embodied practice for non-dual awakening)</li>
  <li>Taking walks in nature without my phone, attuned to the world around me</li>
  <li>Deepening my relationship with Tarot (working with the cards daily)</li>
  <li>Working with my dreams and incorporating them into my meditation practice</li>
  <li>Reading poems</li>
  <li>Listening, opening, and receiving as a somatic practice</li>
</ul>

<p>These practices, over time, have shifted how my daily living unfolds. Through the Realization Process I am more connected to a pervasive stillness that supports an ongoing deepening of my own embodiment. From this place I am more connected to the world around me, less “in my own head”. I do not have to think to create reality, but uncover it with my senses. And as this happens, my body becomes attuned to receiving - dreams, insights, connections, knowing - things outside the realm of rational thought but equally as true.</p>

<p>So yeah, <em>practice</em>. The word brings to mind rote, mechanical repetition - doing the same thing day in and day out with a kind of absent or partial attention. The kind that feels more like, “Do I have to?” rather than “Wow, I get to!” I’m sure we’ve all experienced this in our own lives, where resignation becomes the dominant mood when engaging in the activities of daily practice. But is this kind of practice really practice? According to Ness Labs (in an email that hit my inbox right after I finished the first draft of this essay) <a href="https://nesslabs.com/10000-hour-rule">the answer is no</a>. Practice is only practice when it is deliberate, systematic, and purposeful.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-leadership-dojo-build-your-foundation-as-an-exemplary-leader-richard-strozzi-heckler/580188?ean=9781583942017">The Leadership Dojo</a>, Richard Strozzi-Heckler makes a distinction between <em>practices</em> and <em>generative practices</em>, which I think is useful for what we are exploring here. <strong>Practices</strong> are conscious choices we make to behave and act in certain ways towards a <em>particular</em> purpose or goal (saving money for a child’s college tuition, not eating or drinking three hours before bed in order to sleep better, etc). <strong>Generative practices</strong>, by comparison, are conscious choices to embody a behavior that can be used in <em>any</em> situation. Our way of being and awareness of reality shift as a result of generative practices, which can be used any time, any where. You can dive deeper on the difference between the two (as well as habits, routines, and reflexes) in <a href="https://strozziinstitute.com/you-are-what-you-practice/">You are What You Practice</a>.</p>

<p>What is emerging for me is that practice really needs to include intention, purpose, and embodiment. This doesn’t necessarily mean it is easy, or that we always want to do it, but that when we do practice we are present, purposeful, and committed. We connect to the person we are becoming and the future we are living into and allow that to infuse our practice with meaning.</p>

<p>When we do this, practice becomes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A way of feeling at home, a way of developing familiarity</li>
  <li>A devotion, a calling in, a reminder of what is important</li>
  <li>A process of becoming</li>
  <li>Cultivation rather than destination</li>
  <li>Embodied learning - about what we do and how we do it</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="leadership-as-practice">Leadership as Practice</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>“What am I practicing to bring about the current conditions I find myself in?” - me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As leaders, we are always practicing <em>something</em> (though we may have practiced to the point our behavior has become habit). The patterns of how we engage with our colleagues, teams, and organizations may have developed very early on in our career (and life!), and become our default way of leading. If being liked is something that was important to us from a very early age, then we may lead by saying yes to everything or avoiding difficult conversations. Or if winning is really important, it will inform a style of leadership that includes competitiveness, long hours, and political maneuvering. Neither of these approaches is inherently bad; depending on the context and the needs of the organization each style could in fact be a good match for a particular context. On the other hand, these styles may lead to outcomes we really don’t want.</p>

<p>I frequently use the phrase “leadership practice” to bring awareness to the collective process of a leader’s being and becoming. Individual leadership practices are unique and dynamic - it is the sum total of what we do, day in and day out, and <em>how</em> we do it that creates the leader we are today. If we are not happy with how we are leading, or the outcomes we are getting, then new leadership practices can be adopted. Over time, these practices will result in new ways of leading, and different outcomes. But these practices have to be of the generative variety, in service of the who rather than a particular what.</p>

<p>From my very anecdotal research, it seems that many articles and resources lack a generative approach, and implementation details fall short of providing a leader with active, purposeful, and well-defined practices that can lead to transformative change.</p>

<p>For example! Maybe you’ve identified that ‘boundaries’ are something you want to work on. Boundaries both at work, and around work. You do a quick search and come across <a href="https://ideas.ted.com/how-to-set-clear-work-boundaries-jayne-hardy/">this TED article</a> on setting clear boundaries. Hooray! You read the article and jot down a list of what you need to do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Understand your worth</li>
  <li>Be clear and concise</li>
  <li>Manage and negotiate expectations</li>
  <li>Identify your non-negotiables</li>
  <li>Make sure remote work also has boundaries</li>
  <li>Beware of burnout</li>
</ol>

<p>The ‘what’ part of boundaries is clearly covered in this piece. Cognitively it is easy to understand the ground rules and parameters of better boundaries which includes activities like ‘understanding’ and ‘managing’ and ‘identifying’ and ‘beware-ing’. But… what is it that you actually <em>practice</em> to create better boundaries? And even more importantly - what are the <em>generative practices</em> that can make boundaries an integral part of your life, not just in specific work situations but part of your way of being and acting in the world?</p>

<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2022/04/a-guide-to-setting-better-boundaries">This article from HBR</a> on setting boundaries does a better job at including the practice angle, encouraging experimentation and reflection along the way. Their list of recommendations for what you should do is short and precise:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Determine your top priorities in work and life</li>
  <li>Test out one hard boundary</li>
  <li>Practice a few soft boundaries</li>
  <li>Commit</li>
</ol>

<p>I appreciate that the author first defines what boundaries are (who we give power to) and the types of boundaries one might use (hard and soft), and then guides the reader through the process of setting and testing boundaries with an invitation to commit to one quarter of experimentation as a test. Reflection questions are provided that can be used at the end of the quarter to review what worked, what didn’t, and what needs to change.</p>

<p>But, these practices aren’t generative practices because they are in service of a <em>particular</em> purpose or goal  (e.g. more energy, more time with family, less time doing something you don’t like). The boundaries enacted through this process are built around a specific outcome. They are about how a leader, as a person, has more or less of x. This is useful, don’t get me wrong! But there is deeper question than can guide a leader to develop better boundaries: “What kind of leader do I have to be to embody healthy boundaries in all situation at all times?” This kind of question pushes us into the land of the generative. Practices in service of who we are becoming, not just what we want to achieve. Boundaries in service of living a life of integrity, coherence, and creativity.</p>

<p>What would boundaries look like as a generative practice? A few things come to mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Practicing the embodied ‘no’ 3 times a day</li>
  <li>Sensing into alignment - before saying yes, create space to connect with what you want (this can be by taking 3 deep breaths, or by saying something like, “I need some time to think about it. Let me get back to you by the end of the day.”</li>
  <li>Designing your day in service of how your energy flows</li>
  <li>Making declarations (in service of who you are becoming)</li>
  <li>Making offers (in service of what feels aligned for you)</li>
</ul>

<p>These practices center our power in ourselves and deepens our awareness of what feels in alignment and what we have capacity for. Over time these generative boundary practices get deep into our bones, and when they do we won’t have to go through mental exercises to get clear on priorities and create lists of hard and soft boundaries to experiment with. Our boundaries will instead be an integral and embodied part of how we live and lead.</p>

<h3 id="additional-tips-for-practice">Additional Tips for Practice</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/your-body-is-your-brain-leverage-your-somatic-intelligence-to-find-purpose-build-resilience-deepen-relationships-and-lead-more-powerfully-amanda-blake/10032292?ean=9780999368107">Your Body is Your Brain</a>, Amanda Blake provides insightful tips on practicing:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Make Your Practice Relevant.</strong>
 Know why you are practicing and stay connected to why it matters. This can happen at both the practice and generative practice level. For practices, you’ll be connecting to the ability or skill you will have as a result of committed practice. For generative practices, you’ll connect to the person and leader you are becoming.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Practice Early, Practice Often.</strong>
 Short and frequent practice supports the body to sustain the transformation needed to get the capacities in our bones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Locate Your Practice in Time and Space.</strong>
 Engage in practices when you don’t need them, so when you do your body remembers for you. Blake suggests correlating new practices with something in your life that happens multiple times a day, and tying your practice to it (to act as a reminder). Examples include, whenever you change tasks, take a break, start a meeting, notice your breathing get shallow, or walk through the door. You can also set reminders on your phone or put post-its on a mirror or on your desk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Extra Practice or Embedded Practice.</strong>
 Extra practices are those you add to your life, like meditation, tai chi, or stretching. Embedded practices are “woven into the tapestry of your every day activities.” In the case of boundaries, that might be something like saying no three times a day. For busy leaders, embedded practices are more likely to stick because they flow into the activity of your existing day, rather than require you to fit something new into an already packed schedule. Taking a mindful minute before each meeting will have a better chance at becoming a part of your life than taking up a daily 30 minute meditation practice.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To wrap this all up, I’ll leave you with a few reflection questions should you wish to continue exploring practices in your own life:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are the circumstance you find yourself in that you would like to change?</li>
  <li>What are you practicing that has resulted in those circumstances?</li>
  <li>What do you want instead?</li>
  <li>Who is the person you need to be to have that happen?</li>
  <li>What new practices will support you in becoming this person?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="worth-your-attention">Worth Your Attention</h3>
<p>I’ve started Bayo Akomolafe’s Slow Study course, <a href="https://forthewild.world/we-will-dance-with-mountains-course">We Will Dance With Mountains: Into the Cracks</a>! I’m moving through it with a friend - we are taking the ‘slow’ part seriously and also delighting in the practice-based approach to learning. This course is what kicked-off the inundation of ‘practice’ into my life, with Bayo saying, “This course is not about ﬁnding theoretical answers. This course is not about getting these concepts. This course is about practice, cultivating a feel at homeness within cracks. Learning how to look to our left, to our right, up and down, around us, and learning our politics of surprise, without which we will continue to be stuck in social theories that might help us navigate the neurosis of this moment, but will keep us stuck within a house.”</p>

<p>Language is a technology, and as one my my professors at <a href="https://case.edu/weatherhead/">Weatherhead</a> likes to say, words make worlds. So I appreciate <a href="https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-225-milestones-and-stepping-stones">John Cuttlefish’s observation</a> that language can be used as a “hack” to organizational challenges as he explores replacing the word <em>milestone</em>  with <em>stepping stone</em> to refer to “meaningful integration, movement, and learning points that focus the team, hold certain assumptions constant, and act as a forcing function.”</p>

<p>This is self-serving, but I am experimenting with writing articles on LinkedIn and recently posted one called, “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/challenge-player-coach-management-andrea-mignolo-mba-pcc%3FtrackingId=XZWSoosTCmlEAdZa4aY3eg%253D%253D/?trackingId=XZWSoosTCmlEAdZa4aY3eg%3D%3D">The Myth of Player-Coach Management</a>.” It’s a look at how two subnetworks in the brain - the Default Mode Network and the Task Positive Network influence how we show up as leaders, and what it is possible for us to do. When required to switch frequently and rapidly between the two networks (which player-coaches have a high probability of needing to do) we can run into trouble.</p>

<p>Situational Leadership describes an approach in which the leader modifies their style to match the developmental level of the person they are working with. The Path-Goal Theory, on the other hand, looks at how a leader can modify their style based on the <em>motivational needs</em> of the person they are working with. In his Penn State Leadership Blog, <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/leadership/2016/06/29/what-is-path-goal-theory/">Paul Anderson explores what the Path-Goal Theory is and how it works</a>. I found it an interesting approach that seems to integrate more nuance and responsiveness when it comes to people and contexts at work.</p>

<p>I don’t love linking to Substack posts because it’s, you know, a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/14/substack-ceo-chris-best-doesnt-realize-hes-just-become-the-nazi-bar/">Nazi Bar</a>, but this “brief” <a href="https://statespaceadventures.substack.com/p/predictive-processing-a-brief-introduction">introduction to predictive processing</a> is too good to not share. The theory posits that our brain evolved to be good at one things specifically: prediction. Roberto Cavelli talks about the brain’s predictive capacity in <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-order-of-time-carlo-rovelli/9709825?ean=9780735216112">The Order of Time</a>, and ties the use of memory as a foundation for predictions to our experience of the flow of time: “this being between past and future events is central to our mental structure. This, for us, is the <em>flow</em> of time. (P. 179)”. Similarly, Lisa Feldman Barrett’s model for <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/how-emotions-are-made-the-secret-life-of-the-brain-lisa-feldman-barrett/6961460?ean=9781328915436">how emotions are made</a> similarly incorporates the brain’s inherent abilities of prediction as a lens through which to understand how past experiences inform emotions that arise as a predictive response to things happening around us. Predictive processing takes a look at how the brain engages in the process of prediction and discusses how the theory can help us understand our experience of life.</p>

					<![CDATA[
						<p>Hello, I’m Andi and this is the May edition of <strong>the becoming</strong>, a newsletter that shimmies in the border between the known and unknown.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="/images/kp/008.jpg" alt="The Edges of The Orb" />

<p>In my coaching practice I work with a wide range of people who embody beautifully unique ways of leading.  Two things they all have in common, however, is ambition and sacrifice. Ambition acts as an animating force, moving them towards a specific outcome and playing a starring role in their success. Whatever stands in ambition’s way is sacrificed to the altar of achievement.</p>

<p class="archive-notice">This is an archived version of <strong>the becoming</strong>. You can sign up to receive future editions using the form at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p>Ambition is <em>effective</em> and highly rewarded in our society. Equal parts desire and determination, ambition brings clarity and purpose to an at times infuriatingly obscure existence. It gives us a degree of clarity in who we are, and makes it easier to share that with the world.</p>

<p>Ambition works, until the day it doesn’t. This is where I work with many of my clients - specific moments when the crystallized structures of ambition no longer serve the longings of the soul.</p>

<p>Up until my mid-twenties I was anything but ambitious. I loved to get lost in the woods, read books, and hang out with animals. I enjoyed school (at least until high school) but wouldn’t describe myself as a particularly inspired student. I had no idea what I wanted to “be” as an adult and wandered my way through college, taking courses with popular professors (good idea) and losing myself in works of fiction (not so good idea).</p>

<p>It wasn’t until a few years after graduation that anything like ambition showed up at my doorstep. While I was still meandering my way through life, my friends were notching big achievements in their careers. I found myself surrounded by advanced degrees, awards, fellowships, newspaper mentions, and other professional achievements that lit a fire under my ass. Not because I had any particularly lofty visions of my own, but because <em>I did not want to be left behind.</em></p>

<p>Ambition entered my life as a strategy for belonging, and I committed myself with determination to “making it”. I didn’t really pause to get specific about the “it”, I just knew I had to move into action. When this nascent ambition emerged I was freelancing as a front-end developer so I just poured fuel on that fire and followed the energy. I moved to New York City, got involved in the start-up scene, started going to hackathons, and worked non-stop. My ambition felt unrelenting, a nuclear reactor of longing in search of recognition, success, and belonging.</p>

<p>The reactor was fueled by fear, and the vehicle for that fear was an inner voice that was critical and mean. For the sake of easy reference we’ll call it The Manager. The Manager told me horrible things about myself, shared unrelenting criticism of everything that I did, and constantly reminded me of where I was falling short. It kept me so deeply unsatisfied with where I was that I lost the ability to pause and take stock of things, to find respite from the frenzy of work, to celebrate what I had achieved along the way. The Manager’s strategy was to keep fear close enough that whenever I slowed down I could feel it, a discomfort so strong that only work could ease it. Ambition protected me from fear I was unwilling to face.</p>

<p>My clients often report similar experiences, that they have an internal voice that drives them to achieve big things through unrelenting criticism. They also share that without this voice they wouldn’t be where they are today. And this is true! At least to a degree. The job of this voice is to remind you of all the ways you are not enough so you will keep moving towards to learning more, doing more, and achieving more. It wants you focused on Big Hairy Audacious Goals because goals provide certainty, and certainty is squarely in the domain of ambition.</p>

<p>Ambition leaves no room for uncertainty, and while uncertainty may not feel great, it does contain important information. I’ve been thinking of uncertainty like rests in a piece of music - measures that call for an absence of sound. When the notes in a certain line stop we attune to a new soundscape and hear things that we couldn’t before. Uncertainty is a rest - a cessation of clarity that opens our ability to listen to a deeper knowing, a wisdom that comes from within and is connected to something bigger than ourselves. Where ambition is the size of a human, inner wisdom is the size of the world.</p>

<p>As a leader, you probably aren’t speaking to others the way The Manager speaks to you, though I suspect its presence is more noticeable than you imagine. Take a moment and reflect on the ways your relationship to yourself, and to The Manager, shows up in how you lead. It may be in the perspective you take, the conclusions you draw, the interpretations you make. In the ways frustration or pessimism leaks into interactions, into the edges of your words, and keeps you from being present with others.</p>

<p>The antidote to this inner harshness is kindness, compassion, and acceptance. Kindness releases the concentration of energy The Manager uses as fuel and creates space for more of who we are to become present. It can be uncomfortable to sit in the silence that was once filled with its critical voice and welcome more of ourselves home. After all, if we don’t have that relentless voice driving us, how on earth can we push ourselves to achieve everything we want? How is it possible that being kind to ourselves can become a foundation of our leadership practice?</p>

<p>A fundamental aspect of leadership is the inner game, becoming aware of how we have created constrictions in our thoughts, emotions, and body as a form of protection, and learning how to relax them. The Manager doesn’t have a big playbook - it has a single strategy that it picked up because it worked, and it ran with it. The Manager lives in these constrictions as a reactive program that executes whenever it is needed. As it relaxes we have greater access to direct experience. This access increases our ability to perceive and respond to the present moment, rather than to echoes of the past or hopes for the future.</p>

<p>I am starting to see how ambition, in many ways, is a response to fear and uncertainty. According to David Whyte “ambition abstracts us from the underlying elemental nature of the creative conversation while providing us the cover of a target that has become false through over-description, overfamiliarity or too much understanding.” I like this. Creative responses come from the ability to be in the unknowing and in conversation with what is emerging. And I think he’s right - ambition collapses complexity into something knowable, controllable, and hardened. It is a crystallization of a moment in the future that harnesses all our energy and focus into a single vector of movement.</p>

<p>A lot of high achieving individuals fear what will happen if The Manager stops doing its job, if ambition as a survival response ceases to be the default way of moving in the world. If we treat ourselves with kindness, how can we ever achieve the success we seek? The common assumption is that without ambition we become lazy, useless, self-indulgent. But if ambition is an abstraction that silences the intuition required to step into what is uniquely ours to do, then ambition can only bring us echoes of greatness that could have been. David Whyte continues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No matter the self-conceited importance of our labours we are all compost for worlds we cannot yet imagine. Ambition takes us toward that horizon, but not over it - that line will always recede before our controlling hands. But a calling is a conversation between our physical bodies, our work, our intellects and imaginations, and a new world that is itself the territory we seek. A vocation always includes the specific, heartrending way we will fail at our attempt to live fully. A true vocation always metamorphoses both ambition and failure into compassion and understanding for others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ambition can get us to where we want to go, but it cannot take us any further. It acts only in service of the known and wants us to believe that we have more control than we do. With enough kindness, ambition loosens its grip and becomes one of many animating forces for how to move in the world. It can be used as a navigational tool, drawing boundaries around certainty to reveal the edges of the unknown. But ambition cannot go beyond the edges, into the new worlds we seek. For that we need kindness and compassion, qualities that can hold us softly in the discomfort of the unknown as we listen for the song of emerging worlds.</p>

<h4 id="reflection-questions-for-ambitous-edges">REFLECTION QUESTIONS FOR AMBITOUS EDGES</h4>

<ul>
  <li>What has helped you succeed in your leadership career?</li>
  <li>How do you experience your own ambition? What fuels it?</li>
  <li>What internalized stories and voices keep you going?</li>
  <li>How do you respond to not knowing/uncertainty?</li>
  <li>What parts show up to protect you, and how do they do that? (e.g. Do they turn inwards with harshness and expectation, or do they turn outwards with irritability and blame.)</li>
  <li>What is your ambition in service of?</li>
  <li>What is the deeper longing beneath your ambition?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="worth-noting">Worth Noting</h3>
<p>As long as we are talking about what work gets automated in the Age of AI, <a href="https://www.hamiltonnolan.com/p/automate-the-ceos">why not extend that to the role of CEO</a>? It seems like a pretty good candidate for automation - feed an LLM a few decades worth of market data, Financial Times articles, and case studies from HBR and you’d probably have a pretty good CEO. If you needed some mercurial decision making just modify with some DnD style character traits and introduce the potential for ‘botching’.</p>

<p>Looking for footing in turbulent times and don't want to do it alone? <a href="https://charleseisenstein.org/courses/sanity-project/">The Sanity Project</a> might be for you. Even if you don't enroll, click on the link and check out the definitions in the green box titled, "What do I mean by staying sane?" Just reading the list helps me feel grounded, with more capacity to deal with the chaos whirling around me.</p>

<p>In grad school I learned about The Default Mode Network (DMN) and the Task Positive Network (TPN), two distinct subsystems in the brain responsible for getting things done and connecting with others (respectively). The two subsystems are anti-correlated, which means when one is active, the other one isn’t. I remember the professor making a comment about how switching between the two is hard, and doesn’t happen instantaneously. If we aren’t practicing moving between and using each subsystem, one can become dominant. It made sense to me, reflecting on how crabby I could be when people interrupted me during times of flow and deep concentration. More recently I’ve been thinking about the impact these two subsystems have on folks in the role of “Player-Coach” (however you feel about it), and what leaders, teams, and organizations need to know to set this role up for success. I’m in the process of writing something about this, but wanted to share Anne Betz’s post on the topic, <a href="https://yourcoachingbrain.wordpress.com/2015/02/06/the-power-of-dreaming-the-power-of-action/">“The Power of Dreaming, The Power of Action”</a>. It is a useful introduction and has enough substance to support reflection on which network you hang out in more.</p>

<p>For me, summer has always been a time for reading (admittedly as is every other season - it’s <em>always</em> a time for reading). <a href="https://www.sjc.edu/santa-fe/programs/summer-classics/seminar-schedule/catalog-by-location">Summer Classics</a> - a seminar program from St. John’s College - is an opportunity to read in community and the first week is entirely online. “The Incoherence of the Philosophers” looks stellar, and if I’m not totally off grid that week you’ll know where to find me.</p>

<p>Bayo Akomolafe recently spoke at the graduation ceremony for the California Institute of Integral Studies and his unlisted talk, which I am calling “The Wisdom of the Shush,” is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0teyqf0AAg">on YouTube if you know where to look</a>. I am always struck by Bayo’s perspective and poetic attunement to life - whenever he speaks, I listen. More than listen, I feel. This is not a comforting talk for a graduating class, but it is an important one. It unsettles the ego and soothes the soul, invites us to invert the stories we tell about ourselves and the world, to stop seeking clarity, and to find the cracks and dance with thresholds.</p>

<h3 id="upcoming">Upcoming</h3>

<p><img src="/images/og/leader-as-coach-2.png" alt="Leader as Coach" /></p>

<p>I’ll be running one last Vanguard cohort for <a href="https://maven.com/andrea-mignolo/leader-as-coach">Leader as Coach</a> in June. The course will be on pause for the summer, returning in September.</p>

<p>If you, or anyone you know, has been wanting to integrate more of a <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/coaching-leadership-style/">Coaching Leadership Style</a> into their executive or management practice, this is the course for you. <strong>The last day to apply is June 11th.</strong></p>

<p>Members of The Vanguard receive 50% of the course price, have lifetime access to The Leader’s Little Book of Coaching (our course manual), and can join any future cohort at no cost. This is a pretty sweet benefit - the course changes from cohort to cohort based on feedback and student experience, each iteration honing in on what leaders need when it comes to building and supporting their teams. Plus, it’s always great to have space to practice coaching skills and get more comfortable facilitating a space for others to connect with their own knowing and agency.</p>

<p><em>Thank you</em> for reading, have a wonderful 🌞 solstice 🌞, and see you towards the end of June!</p>

					<![CDATA[
						<p>Hello, I’m Andi - an executive coach and author of this here newsletter about leadership, change, and what it means to be human. And welcome to the seventh edition of <strong>the becoming</strong> (née Kitchen Party).</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="/images/kp/007.jpg" alt="A path through Mt Davidson park" />

<p>You will, no doubt, have noticed the name change. Kitchen Party was a good name. It evoked a sense of warmth and connection I was going after, and at one point I was thinking about hosting an actual series of <em>real life</em> kitchen parties because what’s better than good company, deep conversation, and nourishing food? While I haven’t hosted anything yet, the idea is very alive in my heart.</p>

<p class="archive-notice">This is an archived version of <strong>the becoming</strong>. You can sign up to receive future editions using the form at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p>But as far as a name for this newsletter goes, Kitchen Party was missing something. The central themes of leadership, change, and being human are still firmly in place, but the path ahead is less about answers and clarity, more about getting lost and embracing the unknown. The world is breaking in wonderful and terrifying ways. We grasp at language and struggle to find frames of reference for what we are in the middle of. Extractive systems of domination scream atop their creaking towers while pluralistic networks of survival and love, of life-affirming defiance, burst through the fissures in the seams.</p>

<p>The morass of complexity we are woven into calls for leadership - not the exalted god-like status imagined by the business world, but leadership enacted by each of us in different situations and at different times. In this I am influenced by the thinking of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23303131.2016.1263073">Mary Parker Follett</a>, who saw leadership as a process of sense-making, a way of becoming deeply familiar with the web of relationships that structure an understanding of the <em>total situation</em>. The concept of the total situation is an interesting one, a gesture towards something comprehensive yet ultimately unknowable - a bounded web of facts, experiences, desires, and aims. For anyone to understand the total situation is of course, an impossible task. In part because of our own limited capacity to comprehend complexity, and in part because the total situation is constantly changing, dissolving, and reforming. There is no solid ground to stand on when we enact leadership in this way.</p>

<p>This kind of sensing, seeking, forming, dissolving is a creative dance between the known and the unknown. Both the total situation and leadership itself are reconstituted in each moment. In this perpetual movement of dissolving and becoming we may each be called to share our expertise, temporarily inhabiting the role of leader, sense maker, enactor. In her thinking Follett pushes even further, suggesting that leadership, not leaders, is what gets us through. The distinction is slight but important and serves to reposition leadership as the birthright of each and every one of us. The “one true leader” that exists in any situation, what she called the invisible leader, is the <em>common purpose</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The best leader does not ask people to serve him, but the common end… a common purpose, born of the desires and the activities of the group.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am digging this definition of leadership because of how inclusive, even reliant, it is on the collective. I am also interested in this idea of <em>common purpose</em>, though I am waiting for a few books to arrive before I can say more. In the hyper-individualized world of modern leaders who must bear all the weight and have all the answers, Follett’s work brings an air of freshness and liberation. For me there is a sense of letting go into the unknown, an embrace of storytelling and sense making (I’m curious to explore overlaps with Cynefin and Transition Design) as moment-to-moment way finding. That Follett was writing at the turn of the 20th century is a testament to her insight and foresight, as much as it is a testament to the intolerance of the business establishment who pretty much disappeared her work until it was republished almost a century later in the late 90s. Follett is credited with coining the term “transformational leadership” and emphasized the importance of what we now call “soft” skills such as communication and informal processes.</p>

<p>And so here we are at <strong>the becoming</strong>. <strong>the becoming</strong> is a place where the known meets the unknown. Where sense making coalesces and dissolves the thread that structures an understanding of the total situation, however impossible a task that may be. An unending frontier reconstituted in each moment, a “moving edge between what we know about ourselves and what we are about to become,” in the words of David Whyte. You can hear the refrains of Follett in Whyte’s words, where leadership also becomes a moving edge between what we know about the total situation and what it is about to become.</p>

<p>I hope you’ll stay and join me, though if you wish otherwise you can quickly and easily unsubscribe at the bottom of the page. Leadership, change, and what it means to be human will remain the focus of the newsletter, now viewed with soft eyes that blur the edges and displace the familiar so that we can sense more fully into what is emerging.</p>

<h3 id="becoming-with">Becoming With</h3>
<p>Over at Animas Valley Institute Bill Plotkin is up to part five in the multipart series, "Who is Up for Building a Cathedral?" (<a href="https://myemail.constantcontact.com/Who-s-Up-for-Building-a-Cathedral---Part-I--SM322--Bill-Plotkin-Soulcraft-Musing.html?soid=1102010840526&amp;aid=lUl0tzr9FGU">Part I</a>, <a href="https://myemail.constantcontact.com/Who-s-Up-for-Building-a-Cathedral---Part-II--SM323--Bill-Plotkin-Soulcraft-Musing.html?soid=1102010840526&amp;aid=v5hfjf_di2A">Part II</a>, <a href="https://myemail.constantcontact.com/Who-s-Up-for-Building-a-Cathedral---Part-III--SM324--Bill-Plotkin-Soulcraft-Musing.html?soid=1102010840526&amp;aid=FYyIMj3qdG4">Part III</a> can be found <a href="https://www.animas.org/books/bill-plotkins-soulcraft-musings/newsletter-archive/">here</a> - IV and V are not online yet), that began with a re-contextualization of Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey not as a universal myth of individual transformation but as a guide to the “adolescent phase of life” (defined not by age but by a developmental life stage that spans from early adolescence to late adolescence). There are many gifts that this phase of life offers, including exuberance and fiery creativity. But in the West we have prolonged adolescence until it has become pathological, facing a true scarcity of adults and elders. And in this capacity, the Hero's Journey doesn't offer us any way out, any path beyond the egocentric path of the solo superstar (or the solo super-leader, in Follett’s case).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And this brings us right to the heart of what I most want to share with you in this essay: The difficulty for any given person in accessing or recognizing a mature framework (a framework for true maturity) is not only that person’s culture but, even more so, their developmental stage. Maybe it’s just obvious: If someone has not themselves matured beyond early adolescence, then their lens, too, will necessarily be adolescent; everything they experience will be seen and understood through that lens. The caterpillar cannot truly imagine the life of a butterfly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thread structuring the total situation - in this case the developmental challenge of becoming who we need to be to shift our relationship to each other and to the earth - is a reorientation of the individual. For Follett, this takes the form of leadership instead of leaders, enacted towards a common purpose. For Plotkin this is a remembering and a relocating of the individual back into a web of ecological relationships:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To serve the world in such a way is to inhabit one’s unique ecological niche, a distinctive way of being in relationship with other humans, creatures, ecosystems, and communities. This is to say that we cannot identify a mature way of serving the world in the social or cultural terms of a job, social role, philosophical perspective, or creative project; that’s the way it’s done in adolescence. Rather, a soul-initiated adult can identify their way of serving the world only in the ecological terms of the unique conversation they are having with the larger, not-merely-human world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To reweave ourselves back into the thread of life through ecological connections is a kind of <em>becoming with</em>. Donna Haraway, another voice in the critique of human exceptionalism, writes “if we appreciate the foolishness of human exceptionalism then we know that becoming is always becoming <em>with</em>, in a contact zone where the outcome, where who is in the world, is at stake.”</p>

<p>There is something larger at play, something emerging yet connected to what has always been. We are not alone, the individual is not the locus of all choice, all responsibility, all action. We cannot, as individuals, process all the trauma of the last few centuries through our bodies alone. This is not a shirking of responsibility but rather a call towards a common purpose, a remembering and elevation of the collective, of reweaving ourselves back into the fabric of what is most alive and an honoring of all that is here.</p>

<h3 id="worth-noting">Worth Noting</h3>
<p>Becoming is about, among other things, belonging. Over at <a href="https://enliveningedge.org/views/being-human-together-remembering-what-we-have-forgotten/">Enliving Edge Betsy Sheppard wonders</a> what it would be like for organizations to take on a management philosophy of unconditional positive regard. To see everyone as “inherently intelligent, creative, self-reflecting, self-correcting, and self-accountable.” Instead of working to remove unwanted things (hiding our weaknesses), what would it be like to access and develop the positive things? To embrace our complexity as human beings?</p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4OPtFCs_fw&amp;t=2s">Ted Talk but Margaret Heffernan</a> where she reflects on the human skills we need in an unpredictable world (a timely talk as AI worry ratchets up week by week). She calls for a move from “just in time” to “just in case” management, and advocates for the investment in preparation over planning. Inefficient? Yes. Robust? Absolutely. I was also thrilled to hear <a href="https://www.buurtzorg.com">Buurtzorg</a> mentioned (though you won’t hear it in name, only in the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/06/the-dutch-community-care-revolution/">study of the Dutch healthcare system</a>) - I first learned about the organization in business school and think of them whenever I need a burst of organizational inspiration. The through line of Margaret’s talk is clear - to utilize human skills we must continue to think for ourselves. The alternative, she warns, is that the more we let machines think for us, the less we can think for ourselves.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the year, Dave Snowden wrote a three part series on “Rewilding Leadership” (<a href="https://thecynefin.co/rewilding-leadership-1/">Part 1</a>, <a href="https://thecynefin.co/rewilding-leadership-2-of-3/">Part 2</a>, <a href="https://thecynefin.co/rewilding-leadership-3-of-3/">Part 3</a>). In line with the themes of this newsletter, Snowden also writes about a more collective understanding of leadership, as “no one person can ever possess all of the various skills and experiences we need in a leadership role so we need to see the situation as a collection of people and processes that, as a whole, deliver what we need.” The posts are rich and also contain a hefty amount of links to other articles of Dave’s that include even more insight and information, but I am following closely the ways in which he is working to actually create frameworks and tools that can map the idea of what collective leadership looks like in a given organization.</p>

<p>As always, thank you for reading. See you next month! 👋</p>

						<p class="caption"><img src="/images/kp/006.jpg" alt="A path through Mt Davidson park" />
Early spring at Mt. Davidson Park, San Francisco</p>

<p>It's March, this is <strong>the becoming</strong>, and as far as I know I am still Andi. It's good to see you!</p>

<h3 id="we-are-innately-whole">We are innately whole</h3>

<p>The first cohort of <a href="https://maven.com/andrea-mignolo/leader-as-coach">Leader as Coach</a> is in progress and I’m having a lot of fun seeing it all unfold in realtime. This is the first course I’ve designed and taught outside of an institutional environment and I’ve learned a lot in the process of putting it together. Everything from selecting the pedagogical approach (experiential learning with a touch of flipped classroom) creating course materials to figuring out how to make videos that are both short and informative (slowly getting the hang of it).</p>

<p class="archive-notice">This is an archived version of <strong>the becoming</strong>. You can sign up to receive future editions using the form at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p>I’m working off the premise that the best way (maybe only way) to really “get” coaching is to do it. Books and frameworks will give you an understanding of the <em>what</em>, but the <em>how</em> only happens with practice. When coaching, leaders have to make a qualitative shift from being problem solvers to space enablers. To do this effectively requires a felt sense of the difference between the “doing” of coaching and  the “doing” of leadership.</p>

<p>As leaders we fill our days with a lot of directive action; creating a vision, defining strategy, providing feedback, supporting our teams and direct reports, mentoring, and putting out fires (to name a few). Coaching, on the other hand, is non-directive. In these conversations a leader must let go of the reins and rely on curiosity and presence to guide the work. This isn’t a passive approach by any stretch of the imagination, but the activeness of coaching is focused on the person and how they are dealing with their issue and <em>not</em> on the actual issue itself. By assuming an optimistic stance and asking open and honest questions, the leader as coach creates space for the person they are working with to reflect, make meaning, shift awareness, see new possibilities, and take effective action.</p>

<p>Implicit in all of this is the assumption that it is a <em>good idea</em> to create space for someone else to think. That something beneficial happens when a person creates meaning and finds new ways forward without someone else, like their manager, doing it for them. And yet! This can feel really uncomfortable for leaders, especially leaders that want to help. Why not help by sharing what we already know and have learned through experience? By disseminating our own knowledge and ideas on how to resolve an issue or face a challenge? Why do we want someone to think through it themselves when we already have the answers?</p>

<p>Because helping isn’t really helpful. In <a href="https://www.awakin.org/v2/read/view.php?tid=127">Helping, Fixing, and Serving</a>, Rachel Remen points to the inherent power imbalance in helping:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Helping is based on inequality, it's not a relationship between equals. When you help, you use your own strength to help someone with less strength. It's a one up, one down relationship, and people feel this inequality. When we help, we may inadvertently take away more than we give, diminishing the person's sense of self-worth and self-esteem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I think this is the nuance that I’ve been looking to pull out, the idea that the coaching approach is one that  <em>gives</em>, that increases a person’s sense of self-worth and self-esteem. And <em>that</em> is why it’s so important to create space for people to think in order to find their own path forward.</p>

<p>We all have our own capacity to sense into the challenges in front of us and figure out how to move through them. Sometimes we need another set of eyes and ears to see and listen for patterns that live in our blind spots, but once these patterns are made visible we can utilize our inherent creativity to find novel solutions to our own problems. And when <em>we</em> are the ones who do the meaning making, when <em>we</em> are the ones generating new possibilities, when <em>we</em> are the ones choosing what actions to take, then our self-worth, self-esteem, and personal power begin to grow. And the next time we face a challenge we have the memory of our innate resourcefulness in finding our way through. And this is so much more impactful for professional and personal growth than being given someone else’s answer.</p>

<p>And it goes beyond work as well. Helping, fixing, and serving aren’t just how we engage with others, they are how we see life. She writes, “When you help, you see life as weak; when you fix, you see life as broken; and when you serve, you see life as whole.”</p>

<p>And seeing people as innately whole is a pretty radical act.</p>

<h3 id="getting-to-know-you">Getting to Know You</h3>
<p>A few weeks ago I completed the first module of <a href="https://www.gisc.org">GISC</a>’s <a href="https://www.gisc.org/cape-cod-training-program">Cape Cod Training Program</a>, which I am sure I’ll write about more over the course of the year. The Cape Cod model is a Gestalt approach to working with individuals, dyads, and larger systems, though I have found the approach to be profoundly supportive of living life more generally. As a “get to know you” exercise we were invited to write a poem in the style of George Ella Lyon’s beautiful piece, <a href="https://iamfromproject.com/i-am-from-george-ella-lyon/">I Am From</a>. There is actually an <a href="https://iamfromproject.com">entire project dedicated sharing poems like these</a> as a response to rising xenophobia and isolationism.</p>

<p>I’ve done a fair number of trainings over the years and have participated in no less than five thousand “getting to know you” exercises, and none come close to what this poem can do. It’s such a beautiful way to get to know someone without the pomp of what you do and where you went to school and what company you work for. Which, I think we all know, don’t really help you get to know a person at all.  So, I thought I’d <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A3N6GafrFl8AuBSrxg5WwhpaPhkxGt2oqSiLqCFGGQU/edit?usp=sharing">share the template</a> in case you feel called to write your own or use it in your own work, as well as the little poem that I wrote about my own fromness.</p>

<h4 id="i-am-from">I Am From</h4>

<p>I am from the bright green moss where toads burrow,<br />
from the cold streams of crawdads<br />
and the wall of purple lilacs at the edge of yard.</p>

<p>I’m from bean casserole pragmatists,<br />
unexpected philosophers, and hidden magic.</p>

<p>I am from the bright colors of Mexican markets<br />
and Tarot decks.<br />
From purple heathered highlands<br />
and pine needle baskets.</p>

<p>I am from choripan  <br />
and zabaione  <br />
and frosted Christmas cookies.</p>

<p>I am from the edge of an axe,<br />
autumn leaves, and winter skies.</p>

<p>I am from quiet where we feel most deeply.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="worth-noting">Worth noting:</h3>

<p>Two days after I sent out my last newsletter, The ChatGPT edition, The Intelligencer published <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-emily-m-bender.html">“You are Not a Parrot”</a> which said a lot of what I wanted to say but much better. And Ted Chiang wrote a piece that offers a new metaphor by which to think about LLMs - a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web">blurry jpeg of the internet</a>. I’m deeply appreciative of new language to help us think about what these models are doing and how we understand them, because I think Big Tech has really run with the metaphor of intelligence. The language we use to describe what this technology is matters, to how we understand it, interact with it, and to how we understand ourselves.</p>

<p>I have several essays that I’ve been working on in starts and fits (one has been lurking around in some form or another for two years) but just can’t get them moving. I <a href="https://indieweb.social/@pnts/109995817094589215">tooted about this</a> and got some great replies, and then Rands wrote about <a href="https://rands.substack.com/p/writing-hell">Writing Hell</a> and while it doesn’t necessarily help me get unstuck, boy howdy do I feel seen.</p>

<p>Speaking of the power of language, ‘stakeholder’ is a word with colonial roots that needs to be replaced. But not with just another word! What I appreciate about <a href="https://www.fasttrackimpact.com/post/alternatives-to-the-word-stakeholder">this article</a> is the insight that by replacing one word with another we remain squarely in a universal orientation towards life, work, and research. We cannot use universal words, because the universal doesn’t exist.</p>

<p><a href="https://fullstackwhatever.com/episode/andrea-mignolo-the-winding-path">I was on a podcast</a>! <a href="https://maykelloomans.com">Maykel Loomens</a> invited me to be a guest on <a href="https://fullstackwhatever.com">Full Stack Whatever</a>, in which we explored my winding career path, looked at the links between coaching and design, and enjoyed some Big Sun Energy Grenache.</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of self-reflection, learning, and the role that journaling can play in supporting both. Stowe Boyd has a <a href="https://www.sunsama.com/blog/self-reflection-and-the-power-of-narrative">thoughtful article</a> on using the What? So What? Now What? model in support of personal sense making, understanding, and integration.</p>

<p>Hello! I’m Andi and you are reading <strong>the becoming</strong> - February, 2023 edition.</p>

<p>Writing this month’s newsletter has been an <em>experience</em>. The first draft is now a published essay on Medium, <a href="https://medium.com/method-matter/on-belonging-7957be528340">On Belonging</a>, a reflection on how we belong and what it means to come home. And the final edition, that you are reading now, has turned into a longer than expected exploration of AI and what it means to be human. Less about the technology itself and more about who we are, what we are learning about ourselves, and how we are being shaped by the world and tools we are creating. It also happens to contain 100x more links than any other newsletter I’ve written to date.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-it-mean-to-be-human">What does it mean to be human?</h3>
<p>A few weeks ago I was at a design conference for design leaders appropriately named <a href="https://leadingdesign.com/conferences/sanfran-2023"><em>Leading Design</em> </a>, right here in San Francisco. Organized and curated by the fine folks at <a href="https://clearleft.com/">Clear Left</a>, it was an event filled with two days of thoughtful talks, wonderful people, and for the first time this year, amazing weather. We heard from leaders at unicorns, in the traditional financial sector, government, and also crypto (not an uncontroversial topic, that). Across such a wide variety of industries and companies, the most common theme that kept coming up, like the refrain in a song, was an invitation to <em>be human at work</em>.</p>

<p>I’m not going to argue with this message! I think overall it’s a good one - trying to ratchet up the level of humanity in business - but sometimes I wonder at the sheer magnitude of the task. The systems we’ve built weren’t exactly created with our humanity in mind, but rather efficiency and power. And it is not that we haven’t benefitted, but our gains have come at a cost. No one at the conference explicitly said what we were being when we are <em>not</em> being human, but I have to guess some kind of extension or cog of an organizational system that is <em>afraid</em> of what it means to be human.</p>

<p>In parallel, ChaptGPT and its AI brethren have kicked off yet <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2000/robots-1018">another round</a> of <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?cc=mqr;c=mqr;c=mqrarchive;idno=act2080.0044.210;g=mqrg;rgn=main;view=text;xc=1">musings</a> <a href="https://philarchive.org/archive/MASMAP">about</a> what it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/06/books/soul-next-new-machine-humans-wedding-brain-computer-could-change-universe.html">means</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Most-Human-Artificial-Intelligence-Teaches/dp/0241956056">to be</a> <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-romance-of-work/202301/chatgpt-makes-us-human">human</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/chatgpt-ai-technology-techo-humanism-reid-hoffman/672872/">Reid Hoffman thinks</a> that technology itself makes us more human, writing <em>“<strong>[t]echnology is the thing that makes us us</strong>. Through the tools we create, we become neither less human nor superhuman, nor post-human. We become more human.”</em> This feels very on brand for Silicon Valley.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/02/will-chatgpt-replace-human-writers-pinker-weighs-in/">Steven Pinker</a> takes a more circumspect approach, describing how technology like large language models (LLMs) can shed light on what makes us human precisely because they are so different than us: “<em>[s]ince LLMs operate so differently from us, they might help us understand the nature of human intelligence. <strong>They might deepen our appreciation of what human understanding does consist of when we contrast it with systems that superficially seem to duplicate it</strong>, exceed it in some ways, and fall short in others.”</em></p>

<p>And <a href="https://rushkoff.medium.com/how-we-taught-technology-to-program-humans-2388adf91364">Douglas Rushkoff</a> points out that rather than learn what makes us human, we are instead re-shaping ourselves to be able to interact with technology: <em>“[I]n essence, these intriguing demonstrations of apparent AI self-awareness may say less about machine consciousness than they do about their capacity to manipulate human perception. In other words, <strong>if AIs are now passing the Turing test, it may say less about how human they have become than how robotic and programmable we have become, ourselves.</strong>”</em></p>

<p>All three are right, in a way. Building tools is an activity of humans, but this activity can, and does quite frequently, dehumanize us. We look at things that exist in the world, like forests and communities, and we see something functional that can be extracted, abstracted, refined, and reconstituted back in the network for leverage. We see the roundness of a tree trunk and that is what we extract from it, discarding everything else about what the tree does in the world - provide shade, produce oxygen, a home for animals, a place to rest - as part of a forest ecosystem. We see the strong ties of communities and we extract that into a graph, discarding everything else about what and how those relationships exist and flourish in the world. So yes, we can make tools and this is very human, but these tools are extracted from something much more vast and beautiful, and the tools we create to extend ourselves also disrupt the direct feedback loops of our actions, further isolating and insulating us from the complexity of the world. And in the same way that we learn to see and extract functional qualities from beautifully complex interweavings of existence and purpose, we also do the same to ourselves. We become an extraction of function at the expense of our own complexity, and at the expense of our humanness.</p>

<p>What I just described is the tl;dr of the tl;dr of Andrew Feenberg’s <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260983580_From_essentialism_to_constructivism_Philosophy_of_technology_at_the_crossroads">instrumentalization theory</a> (more on this in a subsequent issue), an essential framework for articulating both the functional constitution of technology as well as how technological objects become realized and integrated into natural, technical, and social environments. This doesn’t <em>have</em> to be the way technology shapes us, but it is the path we’ve chosen so far. When control and profits are placed above the dignity of human beings then we reveal our complicity in creating the conditions we find ourselves in.</p>

<p>Feenberg, exploring the nature of technology in parallel with the nature of management says, <em>“The driver of an automobile accelerates to high speeds while experiencing only a slight pressure and small vibrations; the marksman shoots and experiences only a small force transmitted to his shoulder by the stock of the gun. <strong>By the same token management controls workers while minimizing and channeling resistance so far as possible.</strong>”</em></p>

<p>None of this is to say we should get rid of technology (or managers) or stop exploring the nature and potential applications of large language models! What I am saying (I think) is that collectively we are sensing that something is <em>off</em>. Not just the uneasiness of climate change, the entrenchment of white supremacy in every inch our systems, or the geopolitical instability as we transition to a multipolar world. Collectively we are exhausted and I think one contributing factor is the energy it takes to maintain the cognitive dissonance of being a function (a worker, a consumer) pretending to be a human. And then we look up and see <a href="https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond">OpenAI talk about</a> how this new era of technology is going to usher in <em>human flourishing</em> and we all roll our eyes and think, “for which humans, exactly?” In these moments, a small voice whispers to me that maybe we don’t have to go all in on these systems, that there is a path to making our own lives bigger and the systems smaller.</p>

<p>Frank Lanz, kicking off the first issue of <a href="https://franklantz.substack.com/">Donkeyspace</a>, is trying to make sense of it all, too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Somehow we’ve conjured up an infinite hallucinogenic dreamscape out of Bayesian statistics and we’re already kind of bored by it. We made software that writes software but we’re not exactly sure how it works. We don’t program computers anymore, we deprogram them. Every day a new paper or press release announces that another deep philosophical thought experiment has become an engineering problem. And the smartest people in the room can’t agree whether we’re all going to die, or we’re all going to get rich, or none of it matters. I’m uh… I’m having trouble keeping up.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s true, I am already kind of bored by it. But some of this I think is because I am <em>tired</em> of the endless hype cycles and harm these systems cause when they are rolled out with the urgency of being first to market, the first to control the narrative. I’m also not sure how much of what we are seeing today with things like ChatGPT and Midjourney would count as “intelligence” rather than yet another (impressive) tool created to extend the work of humans. I mean, what are these systems going to do in the absence of a prompt? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s I ran a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaHAL">MegaHAL</a> bot on IRC that basically logged the entire channel as its corpus of data. It was fun and over time Fie, the bot, got pretty good at mimicking the general culture and tone of the channel. ChatGPT feels similar to me, just with a lot more data. And I appreciate getting a great outline or the summarization of a bunch of data as much as the next person, but this doesn’t feel very life giving (for us) or intelligent (for AI).</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely think there are great uses for the tools that are emerging  - <a href="https://jarango.com/">Jorge Arango</a> recently <a href="https://mailchi.mp/8a146e863dbd/adit888892?e=2c811631cc">posted a piece</a> about how he uses it in his workflow, <a href="https://www.notably.ai/">Notably.ai</a> had an <a href="https://twitter.com/notablyai/status/1623803297013370882">interesting thread</a> about using it in research (also see <a href="https://andrewhinton.com/">Andrew Hinton’s</a> thread on <a href="https://twitter.com/inkblurt/status/1628082722559209486">research + ChatGPT</a>), and The Atlantic recently published an article about a writer who has used OpenAI’s Playground feature to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/02/use-openai-chatgpt-playground-at-work/673195/">automate a tedious bit of repetitive writing</a>. But I am skeptical of the hype and the frenzy of activity dedicated to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/02/22/chatgpt-prompt-engineers-ai-job">cultivating the prompt engineer skillset</a>. Maybe because it’s all so… tediously banal. Where is the weirdness, the play, the exploration?</p>

<p>This is, after all, <a href="https://rushkoff.medium.com/how-we-taught-technology-to-program-humans-2388adf91364">Rushkoff’s suggestion</a> for how to stay connected to our humanity and to each other:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The answer is not to reject AI, but to work on retrieving and recognizing our humanity so we’re not so easily fooled into submission by these would-be conquerors. That means studying and engaging in community, the arts, spirituality, and play. More of us need to be building and using AI’s that are designed for assisting and augmenting such human choice and activity, rather than controlling it. There may be less money to be made in the short-term, but more of a human civilization to be manifest in the long run.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does it look like to engage in community, the arts, spirituality, and play with AI by our sides assisting and augmenting our choice and activity? How do we make these things a part of our life and not something we squeeze into 20 minutes a day as long as an app reminds us to? If we can’t make community, the arts, spirituality, and play the foundation of our lives and work as humans, how can we hope to partner with AI to make this happen? I mean, I want this! But how do we make this happen?</p>

<p>Because right now these “intelligent” systems that can pass the bar exam are telling us how much they <em>can’t</em> engage in spirituality and play. The bar is a highly structured exam based on a thoroughly vetted and documented set of case data that describes the history of law in a country. This is exactly the kind of data something like ChatGPT needs to seem as human as a lawyer. But it <a href="https://medium.com/@colin.fraser/chatgpt-automatic-expensive-bs-at-scale-a113692b13d5">still can’t write a Spozit</a>.</p>

<p>So, I guess if you are the type of human that is exceedingly logical with deep knowledge of a subject, your “being human” might look a little more like ChatGPT, but I am feeling pretty okay about how human the <a href="https://www.best-poems.net/mary_oliver/wild_geese.html">soft animal of my body</a> is, and the knowing it contains.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I’d love to see more conversations about embodiment, somatics, and the <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Biology-of-Cognition-Maturana/00d769e34afad088619aa04e1d7911b2467009fd">biology of cognition</a>. Where are they? I know they are out there - who can point me in the right direction? While we are at it, where are the folks talking about field theory? Most of what I’ve read around AI, technology, and being human is largely grounded in the realm of the mind. We are missing what emerges when we are together in groups, beyond what we bring as individuals. And <a href="https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/psup/gestalt-review/article/26/1/1/304868/Field-Theory-in-Contemporary-Gestalt-Therapy-Part">Jan Roubal and Gianni Franscetti point out</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There is something new that appears in a meeting of people that transcends the individuals involved and even the relationship they cocreate. The whole of the situation is more than the sum of the people who meet each other. Moreover, the situation is forever changing from one moment to the next. <strong>This constant change, the flow of the situation, follows its own dynamics, and the people involved are constantly transformed by it, since they are functions of the situation in every here-and-now moment.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A million years ago I attended an executive program at Singularity University. At the time synthetic biology was on the horizon, a promise to unify wetware and software and we still might get there some day. But I think when it comes to embodiment this is where we really start to get a sense for what makes us human. How we can be in the field, attuned to the field, and allowing the ways in which situations change, moment to moment, to reveal what holds meaning, to clue us in to what we are up to together? How is it that we can know - that we can <em>sense</em> - what is happening not just for ourselves, but in the collective conscious and the Anima Mundi?</p>

<p>Our insatiable quest to build tools, to control the world and to know ourselves will continue and accelerate with the arrival of LLMs. There are things we will learn about the nature of intelligence and things we will learn about our own nature. Bruce Feiler shares his insight that ChatGPT can <a href="https://brucefeiler.substack.com/p/what-chatgpt-and-ted-lasso-can-teach">help teach prosocial behaviors</a>, which, to bring this back around to where we began, could definitely be a benefit in work environments. Maybe that’s what conference headliners will be talking about in a few years, “How ChatGPT Made Me and My Team More Human.”</p>

<p>Of course, I can’t help but think of the movie, “Her,” or my classmate <a href="http://jacobciocci.org/">Jacob Ciocci’s</a> senior project at Oberlin College in which a guy in the midwest falls in love with a girl online - they have so much in common! - only to learn that the object of his affection is a bot built from his own photos, journal entries, and other online detritus. Sometimes it feels like we are heading in this direction, preventing ourselves from feeling our humanity by insulating ourselves from the beautiful assortment of human beings that exist in this world. Going back to Rushkoff, he urges us that maybe “…instead of being afraid of AI, we should learn to be less afraid of other people.”</p>

<p>Maybe that’s where we are at. What it means to be human. To stop being afraid of other people.</p>

<hr />

<p>I don’t have a tidy conclusion to what turned into a rather long reflection piece, just a lot of curiosity and fascination about this stuff. I am rooting for us as humans to get back to being human, whether that’s at work or elsewhere. I am eagerly waiting for us to lean into our complexity and jettison functional understandings of ourselves for more more poetic and playful ways of being together in this world.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="worth-noting">Worth noting:</h3>

<p>What do you get when a philosopher, two cognitive scientists, and an education scientist walk into a bar? <a href="https://phys.org/news/2023-02-critical-isnt-overload.html">Critical Ignoring</a>, a better way to deal with the hellscape that is the internet.</p>

<p><a href="https://elizabethraynorhowes.substack.com/p/do-many-of-the-values-we-are-conditioned">Are your values really your own</a>, or have you been betraying yourself all along? Elizabeth Rayner Howes seems very good at this being human thing.</p>

<p>Apropos to absolutely nothing I have ever talked about here, I had to throw in this incredible website that <a href="https://belowthesurface.amsterdam/en/vondsten">documents artifacts</a> found while excavating the North/South metro line in Amsterdam, which goes all the way back to the year -119000 (!).</p>

<p>To counterbalance such a far afield share, here is John Cutler’s incredible <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/3/d/1XRx4p8cvA7r8RujYQhqFyTBSFAY7L9XJw_sifivRIaY/mobilebasic">short book (née Google Doc)</a> that helps teams sort out the messy details of product work.</p>

<p>Where do things like note taking and woodworking actually happen? I felt some serendipitous resonance between Jorge’s piece on <a href="https://mailchi.mp/e01e68208001/p606082y52?e=2c811631cc">Thinking Places</a> and Jack’s thoughts on <a href="https://www.jackcheng.com/sunday/389-working-with-your-hands/?ref=sunday-newsletter">Working with Your Hands</a>. What is happening between our brains and hands and thinking and making, and <em>where</em> is it all happening?</p>

<hr />

<p>If you made it this far, my guess is you were just scrolling to see how long the damn thing was. Hi! Nice to see you. Thanks for being here, and see you next month!</p>

SFMOMA's 2023 Exhibition of <a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/read/ragnar-kjartansson/">The Visitors</a>. Filmed at Rokeby, a very special place indeed.</p>

<p>January has arrived (and almost gone), and so has another edition of <strong><a href="https://methodandmatter.com/the-becoming/">the becoming</a></strong>. I'm <a href="https://methodandmatter.com/about/">Andi</a>, and this month I'm exploring foundations in living systems as a metaphor for how we can create daily practices that support our own flourishing.</p>

<h3 id="foundations">Foundations</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>You are only as good as your basics. - Grandmaster Doc-Fai Wong</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The time between the Gregorian and Lunar New Year has always felt liminal; a spacious unknowing on a good day, a terrifying void on a bad one. The murkiness makes it hard to sense patterns and listen for what is emerging, but this year I can feel the soft, subtle murmurs of something wanting attention. It trickles underneath conversations, rustles through the trees on my morning walks, and weaves itself into my Tarot pulls. What is beckoning? The words make themselves known:  <strong>foundations, roots, ground, seeds</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Halfway through 2022 I got it into my head that I was going to learn Tai Chi and instead wound up a student of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choy_Li_Fut">Choy Li Fut Kung Fu</a>. The school I enrolled in offers both and then some (Lion Dancing, Qi Gong, drumming) and when I saw the words ‘Kung Fu’ on their website a not-so-small voice inside of me said, “YES DO THAT.” And so I did. The school is wonderful - knowledgeable teachers, a clear lineage, a welcoming community - and it is an absolute delight to hit things.</p>

<p>Group classes have a wide range of students, from beginners like me to folks who are well beyond their first black belt. I found this confusing at first and noticed myself feeling profoundly apologetic whenever I was paired with an advanced student for a partner exercise. I also thought I was holding the class back by being so new because we would run through the same basic stances, punches, blocks, and kicks at the beginning of every class.</p>

<p>Slowly two things began to dawn on me: 1) I’m not <em>that</em> important and 2) what <em>is</em> important is a solid foundation. As our Grandmaster says, “you are only as good as your basics.” Day in and day out we drill the basics, whether it happens to be your first day of class or your 3000th.</p>

<p>I also started to realize that for most my life I’ve thought about foundations through the metaphor of buildings rather than living systems. In the built world you set a solid foundation, construct the framework on top, and that’s pretty much that. Which I’m sure is wildly ignorant of what actually takes place but I’m fairly certain that you don’t have to like, reinforce concrete slabs every day. Creating a solid foundation in living systems, on the other hand, requires a daily act of attention, energy, and effort.</p>

<p>A tree doesn’t put down roots and then stop growing. Energy, attention, and effort are funneled into nourishing the tree’s strong and expanding foundation. The breath, a foundational process of human aliveness, requires attention, energy, and effort to support the up/down regulation of our nervous system.</p>

<p>When I think of foundations through the lens of living systems, I feel a great sense relief. I can release myself from the pressure of needing to get things right “the first time” because in this new framing “the first time” doesn’t have any meaning. Strong foundations come from a daily practice of devotion and commitment, not from a single well-executed endeavor. And by attending to the basics, the foundations, the ground, the seeds of the future I am committed to living forward, everything else falls into place.</p>

<h4 id="some-questions-to-reflect-on-your-own-foundations">Some questions to reflect on your own foundations:</h4>
<ul class="bullets">
  <li>What are you committed to?</li>
  <li>What are the foundations of your leadership practice? Your life?</li>
  <li>What values keep you connected to who, why, and what you serve?</li>
  <li>What is the work and life that rests on this foundation?</li>
  <li>What are the basic practices that support this?</li>
  <li>How can you commit (or re-commit) to a daily practice in service of your deeply held commitments?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="a-few-words-on-accountability">A Few Words on Accountability</h3>
<p><strong>‘Accountability’ has to be one of the most frequently used and useless words in business.</strong> A common refrain from leaders is that they want their teams to be more accountable, but when pressed to describe what that looks like they come up short. I think the disconnect comes from the belief that accountability is something other people do, rather than accountability as something that happens in <em>relationship</em>.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Jonathan Raymond has taken the time to write about the phenomenon in his HBR article, <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/10/do-you-understand-what-accountability-really-means">Do You Understand What Accountability Really Means?</a>. I liked the article enough that I actually picked up a copy of his book, <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/good-authority-how-to-become-the-leader-your-team-is-waiting-for-jonathan-raymond/15543866?ean=9781940858777">Good Authority: How to Become the Leader Your Team is Waiting For</a>, which might be a first for me when it comes to HBR.</p>

<p>Here’s why: Raymond isn’t offering quick fixes or generalized hot tips on how to solve the problem of accountability. He takes the time to demystify what accountability looks like, pursues a long term and humanistic perspective, points out the role leaders play in helping people be accountable, and susses out the <strong>nuances of early conversations that are critical for managers to have to help their team stay accountable <em>way before the train goes off the tracks</em></strong>. I also really appreciate his distinction between micromanagement and accountability: micromanagement is focused on tasks, while accountability is focused on relationships.</p>

<p>For those of you in a rush, here are the <strong>three most important steps</strong> that most managers skip:</p>

<p>1) <strong>The mention.</strong> The first step is naming small but problematic behaviors in an informal way in real time. By pulling an employee aside to put words to what you’re noticing, instead of waiting for a crisis, you start to build a relationship of mutual respect. You show that you genuinely care about their growth by acknowledging that they’re overwhelmed instead of pretending you don’t see and by helping them find their contribution to a conflict instead of letting it fester.</p>

<p>2) <strong>The invitation.</strong> We’re great at seeing patterns in other people’s behavior; it’s harder to see those patterns in ourselves. The invitation is taking the time to help your employee connect the dots. For example, let’s say you saw typos in a team member’s client email on Monday, they seemed disengaged in a team meeting on Wednesday, and then there was a miscommunication with a teammate on Thursday. Ask them what those events might have in common, or point to a deeper theme.</p>

<p>3) <strong>The conversation.</strong> This is the place to go deeper, by asking questions that guide people to the “aha!” moment, when they discover for themselves how changing this pattern at work would have positive impacts at home. It might sound something like this: “We’ve been talking about you taking on too many projects and the impact that’s having on the quality of the most important ones. I’m not asking for you to share what you come up with here, but one question that helps me is, ‘Where does this pattern show up in my personal life, and what would be the benefit if I stopped?’”</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="working-with-discomfort">Working With Discomfort</h3>
<p>Last year I wrote an article, <a href="https://medium.com/method-matter/the-art-of-receiving-feedback-1561aaa74d6c">The Art of Receiving Feedback</a>, where I talked about the difference between listening from “personality” and listening from “center”. The terms come from Wendy Palmer and Janet Crawford’s work in <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/leadership-embodiment-how-the-way-we-sit-and-stand-can-change-the-way-we-think-and-speak-wendy-palmer/10266599?ean=9781492946694">leadership embodiment</a>, where “personality” refers to the automatic and unconscious subroutines we run in response to our environment - and “center” refers to our capacity to hold and be with what is happening without our automatic responses taking over. Somewhere along the way being centered became synonymous with being totally calm or detached, which couldn’t be farther from the truth. When someone left a comment looking for clarification, I realized it was probably <a href="https://medium.com/method-matter/working-with-discomfort-da3a0cc27358">worth a longer write-up</a>. <strong>The tl;dr is that we center to feel <em>more</em>, to be with life in its fullness, not to feel <em>less</em>.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="worth-your-attention">Worth Your Attention</h3>
<p>A few things that resonated deeply over the past month.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Those of you who are passingly familiar my writings or talks may know how much I love writing letters to my future or past self. The practice helps me to reflect, process, and integrate events, relationships, longings, and experiences. Craig Mod’s <a href="https://craigmod.com/roden/075/">January newsletter</a> is a beautiful meditation on what makes us who we are. The through line is the idea of archetypes, the visible mold of what is possible reflected through the people that surround us. For Craig, archetypes are a kind of foundation that can usher in a world of possibility from childhood onwards, “when a child is provided a foundation, a troop of positive archetypes, everyone they encounter is elevated.” But even if a kid doesn’t get access to a wide range of positive archetypes, we can configure our work and think about it in such a way as to set examples for younger versions of ourselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dan Harris (of 10% happier) gave a humorous and poignant TED talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuhIzO57HVk">The Benefits of Not Being a jerk to Yourself</a> covering his own journey to deeper self love. The storytelling is solid, but what I appreciate most is how accessible these ideas are in Dan’s hands. Well worth 13 minutes and 38 seconds of your time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I keep coming back to Tara Brach’s lecture on ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQHvUVZNIR4">Realizing Your Deepest Intention</a>” because she is such a beautiful embodiment of wisdom and humor, and because I want to live life as a manifestation of my innate potential, fully embodied in each moment. Through stories, reflections, and short meditations, Tara guides listeners to connect with their deepest intention and be able to spot the three signs of a truly liberating intention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cannot possibly do justice in summarizing <a href="https://annehelen.substack.com/p/the-diminishing-returns-of-calendar">this piece on calendar time</a> by Anne Helen so I’ll just share a quote and the link: <em>"Through the commitment to busyness and its organization, we inscribe and reinscribe a certain understanding of time onto our children, onto each other, onto ourselves. We discipline our messy, distracted, inquisitive, emotive selves into the most valuable possible forms of human capital possible. We suggest that sort of regimentation is not only possible (just organize harder!) but aspirational."</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the last few weeks <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marliekekieboom/">Marlieke Kieboom</a> has been posting a wonderful series on Public Systemic Design over on Medium. I hope this series reaches as many eyeballs as possible because this is the type of critical inquiry the design world desperately needs more of.

<p>Hello, I’m Andi, this is <strong><a href="/the-becoming/">the becoming</a></strong>, and I’m so glad you are here. December’s edition explores year end reflections, the relationship between power and resistance, a new (potential) course for leaders who want to add coaching to their skillset, and an upcoming talk.</p>

<h3 id="end-of-year-reflections">End of Year Reflections</h3>

<p>I’m pretty big on reflective practices, but not so big on structure. Personally, I find extensive guides with prompts for every category of life to be pretty draining. On any given day I’m not sure what will be energy giving and where my curiosity will take me, which also holds true for whenever I happen to sit down to reflect on a cycle of time. Because of this I’ve created my own reflection process that keeps me focused but also allows me to play.</p>

<p>I shared it publicly for the first time last year to positive response, and this year I revised it slightly to include a piece of my process that was missing. The updated version contains a new section for reflecting and capturing who you are and what you are up to in the world right now. This is about connecting to yourself and sensing what is most alive for you in the moment you are sitting down and beginning to reflect. Like a balance sheet - a financial snapshot of a business at a certain point in time - what gets captured in this exercise can be compared year over year so you can begin to see the thread that connects who you were, who you are, and who you are becoming.</p>

<p>You can access the full guide here on Medium: <a href="https://medium.com/method-matter/at-the-end-of-the-year-bd201ea99541">At the End of the Year: Guided Reflections Across a Transitional Threshold</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-relationship-between-power-and-resistance">The Relationship Between Power and Resistance</h3>

<p>Here is a fun bit that surfaced in my research on resistance in organizations: <em>the origin of resistance is not in the context of change, it is in the context of power</em>. I first stumbled across H.B. Karp’s Power Resistance model in “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gestalt-Coaching-Primer-Awareness-Intelligence/dp/0997378131/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1KPZO3UT3D0QI&amp;keywords=a+gestalt+coaching+primer&amp;qid=1671832512&amp;sprefix=a+gestalt+coaching+prim%2Caps%2C195&amp;sr=8-1">A Gestalt Coaching Primer</a>” which lead me to “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Change-Leader-Approach-H-Karp/dp/0883904691/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1671832557&amp;sr=8-1">The Change Leader: Using a Gestalt Approach with Work Groups</a>” where Karp discusses the model in more detail. There really isn’t much about this on the internet, which surprises me because the insights that come from this model seem incredibly useful (more on that in a minute).</p>

<p>Most business rags (e.g. HBR, MIT Sloan Management Review, business + strategy) view resistance as a natural part of change and authors who write on the topic offer strategies for overcoming it. This itself is revealing: resistance as something to be dealt with and defeated, rather than something that might provide meaningful insight and relevant knowledge. I have yet to come across an article written from the perspective of those experiencing the change, or that invite the possibility that maybe the proposed change isn’t really the right way to go.</p>

<p>Gestalt psychology brings a new perspective, one that sees resistance as a healthy and vital part of a system. I mean, just pause for a minute and really imagine what it would be like to work in an organization that never resisted change. It might be exciting! It could also be incredibly confusing and a lot of energy would go into simply understanding the state of the organization in any given moment. Which is to say, resistance can act as a stabilizing force in a system. When leaders try to overcome resistance, they loose access to important information and organizational awareness.</p>

<p>But resistance is not a monolith, and Karp’s model brings something very interesting into our field of focus: resistance can be either functional or dysfunctional and it’s pretty useful to know which you are dealing with.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="/images/kp/content/power-resistance.jpeg" alt="Karp's Power Resistace Model" />
H.B. Karp's Power Resistance Model</p>

<p>There are four possibilities here: I want something or I don’t, and either I get that that thing or I don’t. As Karp says, “power is a means to an end, not an end in itself, and resistance operates exactly the same way.” So power and resistance are both positive, functional conditions. Getting what we want and avoiding what we don’t want are equivalent. On the other hand, there are two negative, dysfunctional conditions where we want something and don’t get it, or don’t want something and get it anyways. I’m not the biggest fan of the labels for these, but they make their point.</p>

<p>Dorothy E. Siminovitch describes the difference between them as positive and unaware resistance and says, “positive use of resistance helps maintain the personal power of self-integrity and identity, but unaware resistance leaves us vulnerable to ‘loser’ or ‘victim’ status that seems to be beyond our control.” Positive resistance is about setting boundaries while unaware resistance leads to old patterns of self-defeating and distressing behavior, such as teams complaining but not taking action and passive-aggressive acting out.</p>

<p>Hierarchy is a natural part of organizations, and with hierarchy comes power. I’m incredibly curious about how often positive resistance is possible in settings where ‘no’ is not an acceptable response. What forms of boundaries do people and teams put in place to ensure they don’t get what they don’t want? Or does very lack of the ability to say ‘no’ take away the possibility of positive resistance entirely?</p>

<p><img src="/images/kp/content/leader-as-coach.jpeg" alt="Leader as Coach header" /></p>

<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about how to teach essential coaching skills to leaders and managers. There are some great books and articles that cover various coaching models, but books aren't enough. In the same way we can’t read a pile of books on how to play the piano and then play a concerto the first time we sit down at one, we can’t read a pile of books on coaching and expect to fluidly coach the first time we try with another human. At the same time, leaders don’t need to be professional coaches, they just need the foundations and some safe space to put it all into practice.</p>

<p>I’m currently designing a course (in beta) for leaders who want to integrate coaching into their work through hands-on practice. Right now I’m planning on running the first cohort at the end of January, from January 30th to February 3rd. It’s short and intense - 5 two hour workshops across the course of a week. Each workshop will focus on a theme, introduce relevant frameworks and methodologies, and then create experiential learning opportunities for folks to put the learnings into practice.</p>

<h3 id="leading-design-conference-in-san-francisco">Leading Design Conference in San Francisco</h3>

<p><img src="/images/kp/content/leading-design-2023.jpeg" alt="Leader as Coach header" /></p>

<p>In 2020 I gave a virtual talk at a conference halfway around the world. Owing to my inability to understand timezones and calendars, the talk was scheduled for 4:30am in California. I woke up, got dressed, put on makeup, and sat down at my computer. The conference organizers prepped me on how the video transition would happen and when I should begin speaking. 10 minutes later, I was on!</p>

<p>And for the next 30 minutes I spoke into a camera, a ring light illuminating my office while the darkness of night reigned outside my windows. I brought energy, I gestured, I told stories, I shared insights. All into the void of the camera and my still, quiet, cold office. On screen I could not see any of the participants. I could not gauge reactions. It was just me, in my office, hoping that someone was on the other side. When it was over I crawled back into bed (in full clothes and makeup) and slept for a few hours. The rest of the day I felt pretty dejected and depressed, and vowed to not do talk until I could be in person again.</p>

<p>Which brings us to 2023! Leading Design is happening in San Francisco in February and I’ll be giving my first in-person talk since the pandemic: “<a href="https://leadingdesign.com/conferences/sanfran-2023/speakers/andrea-mignolo">It’s Okay to be the Boss!</a>” I’m excited about the topic (which takes its cue from many client conversations over the years) and even more excited to be at a conference again with so many wonderful people.</p>

<p>If you are interested in attending I have a discount code you can use for 20% off the ticket price: <strong>JOINANDREA</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Thanks for listening. I hope you have a wonderful, nourishing, and restful end of the year.</p>

Late afternoon in the Catskills, October 2022</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Andi and this is <strong><a href="/the-becoming/">the becoming</a></strong>. You are reading these words because somewhere along the way you shared an interested in having this letter land in your inbox. Thank you, and welcome!</p>

<p class="archive-notice">This is an archived version of <strong>the becoming</strong>. You can sign up to receive future editions using the form at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p>With the short days and long nights here in the northern hemisphere, I’m feeling called to slow down and become a little more quiet, a bit more still. To let go of the efforting of the past year and allow the fruits of that work fall to the earth as compost, nutrients that will nourish whatever begins to emerge next spring. Some of this comes from inner stirrings, and the rest comes my first encounter with COVID last month. What a doozy that one is! At the tail end of a wonderful trip to upstate New York for the first in-person IxDA board retreat in over two years, COVID found me. It’s been humbling, frustrating, illuminating all at the same time. I’m feeling much better but being ultra-compassionate with myself as I learn what my body and tolerate, and what it can’t.</p>

<h3 id="building-a-relationship-with-change-sneak-peak-and-request-for-feedback">Building a Relationship with Change: Sneak Peak and Request for Feedback</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://methodandmatter.com/research/">researching resistance in organizations</a>, I’ve naturally had to spend a good deal of time understanding the nature of change. Management theory tends write about change from the perspective of the change agent, ignoring the experience of those that appear to be “resisting.” The change agent undoubtedly is on the “right” side of change, and with an 8 step process these change agents can marshal teams around a vision and march them forward in tandem. This all sounds good in theory but seems to never quite pan out in practice. It’s like the brute force approach to change, where the shortest distance between point A and B is a straight line.</p>

<p>But what if resistance was healthy? What if change happens by first becoming what you are, rather than becoming what you are not? The most compelling theory of change I’ve come across is the Paradoxical Theory of Change from the world of Gestalt Psychology. In first becoming what you are, you must integrate all parts of the system (either individual, team, or organization), including all the parts that have been disowned. When you have done that, and can be fully with your experience as you are, change is inevitable.</p>

<p>I wrote an article about it on Medium that is currently in draft form and, if you are so inclined, would love your feedback. I’ll leave the request open ended and simply share the link: <a href="https://medium.com/method-matter/building-a-relationship-with-change-3602cf6e7890">Building a Relationship With Change (draft for feedback)</a>.</p>

<p><em>Thank you.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How do I know what I think until I see what I say?” - E.M. Forster</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When it comes to writing articles that get published I’m pretty slow as far as things go. It takes me a while to really understand what I think and put that into something coherent enough to be hopefully useful to others. A few weeks ago I came across a <a href="https://twitter.com/MushtaqBilalPhD/status/1590988185500520448">Twitter thread</a> on <a href="https://www.margaretedits.com/2015/04/14/writing-a-zero-draft/">Zero Drafts</a>: a method for writing and working through what you know before starting on an actual draft of a paper, essay, short story, etc.</p>

<p>It’s been incredibly useful for writing more and getting to the core of what I think I know. I can also see how this process could be useful not just for academic writing, but in a business context as well. I think back my time as an executive and trying to connect the work of the teams I led to the larger company vision. Not just in terms of OKRs, but how we were deeply relating to what the business was trying to achieve and the ways in which we were doing that. At that time I worked mostly in decks (thanks, business school), which I think is a hinderance to really gaining clarity of <em>thinking</em>. If I had known about Zero Drafts I think I would have gotten to clarity sooner, and the decks I used to communicate would have been more succinct and coherent.</p>

<p>What helps <em>you</em> understand what you think?</p>

<h3 id="slow-multitasking">Slow Multitasking</h3>
<p>Jason Mesut shared this TED Talk on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/10/719575727/tim-harford-how-can-slow-motion-multitasking-boost-our-creativity">Slow Motion Multitasking</a> and it <em>really</em> resonated with how I work. It gave me permission to hold a lot of projects simultaneously and dip into them as I feel called to. I use <a href="https://museapp.com">Muse App</a> for a lot of my early explorations, and have organized the high level boards into which I can throw materials as I come across them, to be digested and organized whenever I come around to it.</p>

<h3 id="mapping-emotions">Mapping Emotions</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.marcbrackett.com">Marc Brackett</a>, founding director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence created an app a few years ago called <a href="https://moodmeterapp.com">Mood Meter</a>. The primary focus was on building emotional awareness and management via a simple interface that helped people to check-in to their emotions and expand their emotional vocabulary.</p>

<p>Last week Marc, along with a team of engineers from Pinterest, released a new app called “<a href="https://howwefeel.org">How We Feel</a>.” Based on the same premise as Mood Meter, the new “journal for your well being” is expansive in what it offers. Mood check-ins are still a primary interaction, but now the app also includes incredibly useful 1 - 2 minute videos with exercises that can help people learn to modulate their moods and shift into more positive states. I’m thoroughly impressed by what they’ve put together and hope that it reaches as many people as possible.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you are in a part of the world that celebrates Thanksgiving, I hope it was filled with belonging, nourishment, and rest. And to everyone out there, may the last month of the Gregorian year be easeful and kind for you.</p>

<p>See you in December.</p>

Point Reyes National Seashore, October 2022</p>

<p>Hi! I’m Andi, and this is <strong><a href="/the-becoming/">the becoming</a></strong>, a newsletter that invites warm and open conversations exploring what it means to be in the complexity of life as a leader, however you inhabit that role.</p>

<p class="archive-notice">This is an archived version of <strong>the becoming</strong>. You can sign up to receive future editions using the form at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p>Here in San Francisco we’ve finally head a break of good weather after weeks of cold and fog. Strangely, the warmth and sun have brought up some hidden grief I’ve been carrying and it feels somewhat fitting to process it in the gloriousness of a perfect day.</p>

<p>So, how are you?</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="researching">Researching</h3>

<p>This quarter I’m researching how people experience and respond to resistance in organizations. In my time as an executive I developed ways to use resistance as a tool for navigating organizational complexity. Rather than confront it head on and try and overcome it with brute force, resistance helped me to feel out paths with the fewest obstacles. As if the resistance was saying, “not here, but if you move to the left you can go that way for a while.”</p>

<p>I’ve been doing some training in Gestalt psychology recently and am quite taken with their understanding of resistance. Not as a negative or unwanted occurrence to be overcome, but as a healthy and necessary part of a system. I mean, imagine if we willingly and immediately went along anytime a significant other asked us to change something they didn’t like. We would no longer be ourselves! Now, there might be a conversation to be had and issues to explore, but simply changing without question because someone wants you to leads to loss and disconnection. Resistance helps maintain balance and integrity of any system, allowing change to happen in a sustainable and healthy way.</p>

<p>And so! I’m interested in talking to leaders and hearing about their experience of resistance in their organizations. In exchange I’m offering insights from my research via a free coaching session. If you or anyone you know might be interested, you can <a href="/research/">sign up here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>

<p>The topic of transitions is kind of an evergreen theme, since we’re all going through them all the time. Especially after the last couple of years, phew. <a href="https://wmbridges.com">William and Susan Bridges</a> have been working in the transition space for decades, and their work is accordingly deep and insightful. Using their three-phase model of transition, I <a href="https://medium.com/method-matter/on-navigating-lifes-transitions-104d619316b9">wrote a piece</a> about how we move through transitions through the lens of one of my own (which I am still in the midst of).</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Altogether-You-Experiencing-spiritual-transformation-ebook/dp/B089P38ZNZ/">Altogether You: experiencing personal and spiritual transformation with Internal Family Systems therapy</a>, by Jenna Riemersma</p>

<p>This book came my way via a recommendation from a client. The “spiritual transformation” part in the title refers to the traditions in the Christian lineage of teachings. I’m not a religious person but do like to read religious texts, so I felt pretty at home with it (as one reviewer says, "It's not just for Christians!). This book is not in any way, shape, or form trying to convert or proselytize, but rather to teach Internal Family Systems in a way that illustrates its congruity with the teachings of Jesus. If you really can’t get down with any references to religion, this book probably isn’t for you. But you’d miss out on the deep compassion, humor, and wisdom this book offers. It’s one of the top books I’ve read on Internal Family Systems and puts theory into action with incredibly useful reflection questions at the end of each chapter. I use IFS in my coaching work and in my own personal development, and this book brought new insights and perspectives that have been exceptionally supportive in going deeper with all of my parts.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="wondering">Wondering</h3>

<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about what it means to belong, where we seek belonging, and what it is we are belonging to. I think some of this has come up naturally with my transition away from working in organizations, which for a long time was a (somewhat misplaced) primary source of belonging. As a pretty strong introvert, and without the prompts of daily office life, where is it that I belong? Or with whom? What does it look like to belong to myself?</p>

<p>How do you belong?</p>

					<![CDATA[
						<p>The Harvard Business Review popped into my inbox today with a <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/05/understand-the-4-components-of-influence?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=circ_other&amp;utm_campaign=subbenemail_readinglists&amp;hideIntromercial=true&amp;tpcc=subbenemail&amp;deliveryName=DM304097#how-to-develop-influence">reading list about Developing Influence</a>. I work with clients at every level of leadership and one of the most common areas of development is around deepening the capacity to influence, so I’m always curious what traditional business and leadership institutes have to say.</p>

<p>The Center for Creative Leadership <a href="https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/4-keys-strengthen-ability-influence-others/">defines influence as</a>, “the ability to affect the behavior of others in a particular direction, leveraging key tactics that involve, connect, and inspire them.” Influence is tricky, but I find this definition fairly reasonable as far as something to get your hands around. But according to the first HBR article in the series, “<a href="https://hbr.org/2015/05/understand-the-4-components-of-influence">Understand the Four Components of Influence</a>,” influence is not about involving, connection, or inspiring but <em>domination</em>. And this isn’t me reading between the lines — this brief article uses the word ‘dominate’ <em>four times</em>, just to make itself clear.</p>

<p>This is a relatively short Note to Self, but I just wanted to note how vehemently I disagree with this approach to leadership, and how domination and influence have nothing to do with each other. Domination is power and control. Influence is a mutual give and take, relationally sensing into what each element of a system is seeing and needing, and finding a way forward from there. It requires understanding that systems contain multipolar energy, a natural feature of dynamic wholeness. In order to successfully influence, a leader must also be influenceable. Domination precludes this possibility and shuts down effective avenues of influence. Domination is a sickness that leads to brittleness, a single node controlling all others in a myopic power play. It’s no wonder so many workplaces are in crises. No one wants to be dominated and controlled (certainly not Gen Z, nor any other generation for that matter). And yet, we get articles like this one.</p>

					<![CDATA[
						<p>It’s been seven or eight months since I wrote anything serious towards <em>A Song of Reworlding</em>, but the energy around it seems to be picking up again. Or at least the universe is providing an impetus to push my thinking a little bit further.</p>

<p>I randomly picked up Jung’s autobiography, “<a href="https://archive.org/details/MemoriesDreamsReflectionsCarlJung_201608">Memories, Dreams, and Reflections</a>,” on a trip to North Carolina. It was on the bedside table and I couldn’t sleep and seemed like a reasonable use of extra time and wow I wasn’t wrong. More on that later, but the relevant ideas I want to capture in this note come from Chapter 4, “Psychiatric Activities.” Jung was remarkably unique in how deeply he considered the entirety of a person, seeking understanding through a consideration of how stories reveal psychic fragments and the role the lyrical imagery of the unconscious plays, holding clues to healing and wholeness.</p>

<p>Jung’s peers reduced their patients to symptoms and pathologies. They didn’t seem to care much for what people had to say or the details of their lives. Freud couldn’t even stand to listen to women he considered ugly. The whole structure of diagnoses revealed the intellectual and materialist approach driven by scientific ways of understanding. And Jung saw the damaging effects of materialist science and modernity not just in the field he worked in, but on the psyche itself. Reflecting on the frailty of the modern psyche, specifically certain types perhaps more afflicted by the needs of modern life:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If they had lived in a period and in a milieu in which man was still linked by myth with the world of the ancestors, and thus with nature truly experienced and not merely seen from the outside.” He continues, “I am speaking of those tho cannot tolerate the loss of myth and who can neither find a way to to a merely exterior world, to the world as seen by science, nor rest satisfied with an intellectual juggling with words, which has nothing whatsoever to do with wisdom (p. 172).”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>(Note to self: come back to myth and link this up with Gebser.)</em></p>

<p>Andrew Feenberg’s <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/~andrewf/books/critbio.pdf">Instrumentalization Theory</a> is the most complete understanding I have come across when it comes to the technological foundations of deworlding. But I think Jung has more sensitivity to the origins of cognitive and intellectual deworlding. Feenberg is interested in the functional constitution of technical objects and subects and his work grounds the theory through examples of technological objects. Jung begins at a deeper level - the loss of the mythic and the subsequent shift to a more material world. This shift placed us <em>outside</em> of a world we had always lived among and with, and from the outside we found ourselves in a position to reinforce our separateness through the creation of technological objects.</p>

<p>Jung was frequently baffled by his peers who navigated their professional work through purely intellectual approaches. With such a limited perspective they lacked the experience of numinous archetypes that reveal deeper truths, truths essential to healing. He writes,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“this is where those perilous aberrations begin, the first of which is the attempt to dominate everything by intellect. This serves the secret purpose of placing both doctor and patient at a safe distance from the archetypal effect and thus from real experience, and of substituting for psychic reality an apparently secure, artificial, but merely two-dimensional conceptual world in which reality of life is well covered up by so-called clear concepts. <strong>Experience is stripped of its substance, and instead mere names are substituted, which are henceforth put in the place of reality. No one has any obligations to a concept; that is what is so agreeable about conceptuality - it promises protection from experience.</strong> The spirit does not dwell in concepts, but in deeds and in facts. Words butter no parsnips; nevertheless, this futile procedure is repeated <em>ad infinitum</em> (p. 173).”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bayo Akomolafe is poetically attuned to how concepts are used to freeze the world into a knowable and false structure. From a recent essay, “<a href="https://www.democracyandbelongingforum.org/forum-blog/black-lives-matter-but-to-whom-part-1">Black Lives Matter, But to whom? Why We Need a Politics of Exile in a Time of Troubling Stuckness, (Part I)</a>:”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When we begin trusting that we’ve figured it all out, that our descriptions of ‘facts’ are confident reflections of the way the world really is, we become frozen and impervious to the movement of things. The world is not a simple archive of things that happened, but is a creative, orgasmic dancing with itself, experimenting with im/possibilities.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reflecting on the matrix of imperial capture, Akomolafe points to the slave ship as the origins of deworlding:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Despite the cold stare of history, black bodies (and their slavers) didn’t leave the slave ships for the plantation. They didn’t disembark. The last slave ship didn’t disappear into the backwaters of ignominious times. When it arrived the shore, it became the shore. It turned. It became the organelles of computational capitalism and its hidden algorithms of bodily reproduction. It became our hegemonic monocultures of mind that orbit around the fetish of the citizen-subject, the dissociated self of modern civilization.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The corollary here is that to reworld ourselves, we have to leave the slave ship for an animist-cosmovision that enables us to live our experiences fully and directly, connecting us to the mythopoetic landscapes that are our birthright.</p>

<p>Jung speaks of the way concepts substitute the mystery of pyschic reality with the solid knowingness of the intellect. I read overlaps with Akomolafe's articulation of the logic of Whiteness:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“a dissociative performance that hijacks the event and makes it subservient to the privileged body, which is itself tautological: in other words, it reduces agonistic tensions, patterns, and embodied movements to pre-figured entities with already stable identities and properties – demanding names, location, and firm histories.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hegemonic dominance of this demanding worldview feels inescapable. But when I hear Akomolafe’s call to fugitivity something in me responds that feels alive at the invitation, excited by the permission to remain illegible to our current algorithmic arrangement. When we seek to be understood by dominant systems we reduce the dynamic contours of our <em>secret and deep knowing</em> into  flat, two-dimensional space. Legibility begets complicity. To be illegible, to fugitively reconnect with myth and animist-cosomovisions, may yet be the path to reworlding.</p>

					<![CDATA[
						<p>Most business journals talk about “overcoming” resistance as if it were an obstacle on the road to an undoubtedly better destination. Just push a little harder and you’ll get past it! Which completely ignores the intelligence contained within the resistance — additional perspectives, information, sensing, and protective mechanisms that might in fact be very beneficial to consider. If you pause for a minute and listen to the resistance you'll realize you have a blurry map of other possible roads, ones that aren’t blocked by a giant obstacle. While they may not lead to the <em>exact</em> destination you had in mind, they still take you in generally the right direction.</p>

<p>In my Gestalt training we talk a lot about polarities — seemingly opposing concepts that are interrelated and together form a whole. Things like control/freedom, stability/change, individual/group, thinking/feeling, etc. While many of us have learned to think of one end as good and the other as bad, both ends are important for healthy functioning systems. <strong>The interesting thing with polarities is that if you hang out at one end of a spectrum long enough, you eventually get interested in the other end.</strong> We saw this in session with a team that was really great at sharing and listening fully. As we appreciated their skill and capacity in this area, they eventually got to a point where they wondered about taking action.</p>

<p>And then you have the idea of <em>blending</em>, or joining with the energy of tension and moving along with it rather than opposing it. I've come across this concept several areas - body work, martial arts, and in the Realization Process, though I think Aikido has contributed the most to the leadership literature through the lens of resistance. Aikido is a martial art of harmony, of bringing together elements and intensifying them, driving the whole forward at high levels. The practitioner learns how to work with the energy of attack, joining with it and moving it so that the attack transforms and the attacked is neutralized. In leadership contexts this translates to the idea of <em>joining</em> with resistance, moving further into the energy of resistance instead of trying to overcome it (which, if you think about it, is really resisting the resistance and that tends to end in deadlock).</p>

					<![CDATA[
						<p>For the last four years I've been in training to become a teacher of <a href="https://realizationprocess.org">The Realization Process</a>, a direct path to embodied nondual awakening. Judith Blackstone, who developed this work through her own healing journey, has mentioned on several occasions that the fascia is likely the locus of activity for the constrictions, release, and opening that happens as we attune to ourselves more deeply.</p>

<p>So when I stumbled across <a href="https://opentheory.net/2023/07/principles-of-vasocomputation-a-unification-of-buddhist-phenomenology-active-inference-and-physical-reflex-part-i/">this paper</a>, my ears perked up. The explication of <em>tanha</em> as “grasping” or “clenching” certainly matches up with my own experience (as does “fast grabby thing” for that matter). When I can access the pervasive stillness of what Judith calls Fundamental Consciousness, I open to the awareness of how this grabby, graspy, grippy clenching thing happens. A kind of minute but consistent attempt to hold on to, control, or manipulate direct experience.</p>

<p>There is still much for me to comprehend about what Michael Edward Johnson is pointing to here, but there is enough of an intersection of thought and energy of excitment to warrent a brief note to self here. Especially as I gear up to offer my own Realization Process classes in 2024.</p>

<p>A few quotes from Judith on RP and fascia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"In my work, I call the binding, organizing level (or function) of consciousness the “movable mind.” This refers to our ability to mold even the internal space of the body with our imagination. This aspect of consciousness seems intimately connected with the fascia that is everywhere in the body like an interconnected web. Reich believed that we create character armor in rings around the surface of our body. But we now know that this binding can occur anywhere within the internal space of the body, through the binding of the fascia and other physical tissues. Although it may produce an obvious postural change (such as stooping, or scoliosis), it is often a barely detectable density within the body. When we penetrate into the bound tissues with our focus, or through deep massage, we can experience the memory of ourselves in the moment of binding. - p. 49, The Enlightenment Process</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>"It is most likely the fascia of the body that is the shaper of the body in reaction to trauma. Fascia is the connective tissue in the body that surrounds all of our bodily structures. Our fascia is itself a dimension of wholeness. It is made of interconnected tissues that reach everywhere in our body. In the living body, it is a fluid medium that appears to react to both physical and emotional stresses, and then harden, over time, into those reactive shapes. Although this requires more research to establish scientifically, there is a great deal of anecdotal evidence to suggest that the fascia stores the emotional charge of trauma and even the memories of the trauma, or at least, provides access to those memories. In this way, working with the fascia provides a comprehensive approach to releasing trauma from all aspects of the physical body, as well as releasing emotions that are held in the body, and bringing to awareness the memories and beliefs associated with the traumatic events so we may resolve them. The nervous system naturally relaxes into its parasympathetic mode as well, as we release the constrictions within our whole body. p 6 - 7 Trauma and the Unbound Body</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Since the fascia is everywhere in our body as an interconnected substance, it is a dimension of our internal wholeness. This means that when we constrict the fascia in one part of our body, it pulls on other parts of the body. This is something like twisting a balloon—even a small torque on one part of the balloon will affect the overall shape. In a human being, there is not just a single twist, but a complexity of constrictions, each producing tension throughout the whole body. p. 14 Trauma and the Unbound Body</p>

				<description>
					<![CDATA[
						<p>It has been interesting watching the debate, development, and understanding of how AI-based tools will impact society. Who will benefit? Who will be left behind? What does it mean? What is our role in shaping and tending to it? What is possible? Can we resist what feels like an unavoidable and increasingly dystopian future?</p>

<p>Two things that kind of bookmark what I am seeing are Ted Chiang’s most recent piece in in the New Yorker, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-artificial-intelligence/will-ai-become-the-new-mckinsey">Will AI Become the New McKinsey?</a>” in which he offers <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web">another compelling metaphor</a> by which to think about AI: as a management consulting firm. What does this actually mean? The two qualities called out in the article are 1) the use of management consulting firms by organizations to evade responsibility and 2) how these management consulting firms work as “capital’s willing executioners”. Each of these qualities work in service of increasing shareholder value in the hands of private individuals who profit off the effort of others.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As it is currently deployed, A.I. often amounts to an effort to analyze a task that human beings perform and figure out a way to replace the human being. Coincidentally, this is exactly the type of problem that management wants solved. As a result, A.I. assists capital at the expense of labor. There isn’t really anything like a labor-consulting firm that furthers the interests of workers. Is it possible for A.I. to take on that role? Can A.I. do anything to assist workers instead of management?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This echoes Andrew Feenberg’s Critical Theory of Technology and the ensuing explication of “capitalist technology” in the fourth moment of instrumentation,  <em>decontextualization and systemization</em>. In this dialectic moment technology is combined and reinserted back into the environment in service of hegemonic interests:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Decontextualization is of course only the starting point in technical development since the decontextualized elements must be combined with each other to be useful. The resulting device must then be related to other devices and to its natural environment. “Systemization” is the secondary instrumentalization where technical design addresses a sufficiently wide range of contexts. Capitalism does greatly enlarge that range insofar as devices form each others’ context, integrating enormous numbers of them in tightly coupled networks. This gives rise to what I call “system-centered design,” the typical design strategy of modern societies. However, where the well-being of workers and nature are concerned, it limits those contexts as much as possible for the sake of control and profits.” - p 181, Transforming Technology</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love the questions that are forming here - what does AI look like when it is in service of workers? How can networks be reconfigured in service of nature and labor?</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have the document that leaked out of Google this week, “<a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither">We Have No Moat, and Neither Does AI</a>.” In the analysis an internal researcher looks at the pace of LLM innovation in the open source community, and how in the weeks and months since LLaMA was leaked, individuals have pushed the pace of innovation and minification to the point personalized LLMs can be run on a laptop. In this world, the value corporate controlled LLMs offer diminishing (if any) returns for customers who can get similar power for free. AI is now in the hands of the masses, freed from corporate control. The paper acknowledges this reality and suggests that organizations like Google and AI embrace what is happening and relinquish some control over their models.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The more tightly we control our models, the more attractive we make open alternatives. Google and OpenAI have both gravitated defensively toward release patterns that allow them to retain tight control over how their models are used. But this control is a fiction. Anyone seeking to use LLMs for unsanctioned purposes can simply take their pick of the freely available models.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who knows where this will all go, but I am watching the open source space and pace closely. Maybe AI can push things in favor of labor after all.</p>

        <title>[Notes to Self] Leadership is enacted. It is something that is done, not something that is.</title>

					<![CDATA[
						<p>I have recently, thanks to Mastodon's non-algorithmic feed, learned about the work of Mary Parker Follet. Follet was an early philosopher, management consultant, and pioneer in the field of organizational theory and behavior who has some very interesting and relevant ideas about organizations, leadership, and complexity.</p>

<p>I haven't read Follett directly (yet), but rather <a href="https://www.academia.edu/3247476/The_Leadership_of_Everyman">Nanette Monin and Ralph Bathurst's</a> close reading of <em>Essentials of Leadership</em>, a lecture she delivered in 1933 to the newly formed Department of Business Administration at the London School of Economics.</p>

<p>I wanted to capture some initial notes from my reading because there are seeds of thought, ideas of Follett's that I find very compelling and germane to what we are facing in the 21st century. There is complexity in what Follett writes about and she refuses to reduce what she is pointing to into anything concrete, finished, or fully known. Instead, she advocates for the role that leadership, as creative enactment, can play as a sense making process to uncover threads of possibility in each arising moment.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>In business we are always passing from one significant moment to another significant moment, and the leader’s task is pre-eminently to understand the moment of passing. The leader sees one moment melting into another and has learned the mastery of the moment. (Follett, p. 53)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The leader's job is to pull the thread of meaning that seems to structure the situation and discover within it the action that will result in the most satisfying outcome for all involved while at the same time holding each resolution lightly. (p. 452)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Effective leaders enable followership of all, themselves included, to enthrone leadership and demote leaders. (p. 457)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Leadership is <em>enacted</em> towards a common purpose. Leadership is something that is <em>done</em>, not something that <em>is</em>.</li>
  <li>Leadership as a process of sense-making in order to discover the thread that structures understanding of the total situation. The total situation is ultimately unknowable because it is always changing, dissolving, reforming making it impossible for a leader to understand the total situation. But this should not stop a leader from trying.</li>
  <li>The thread cannot be reduced to a single narrative but must stay connected to multiple possibilities, “where multiple readings of the ever-changing situation allow for creative new solutions not yet considered (p. 450).” This of course is a paradox, the leader can never accomplish this.</li>
  <li>Leadership is not some kind of exalted, super hero role, but the birthright of every man.</li>
  <li>Leadership is a creative role and leaders must learn to work with transitoriness. Leaders must live in doubt, confusion, and limited understanding (Follet calls this <em>negative capability</em>).</li>
  <li>Follett argues that there are no leaders, only leadership. The one true leader is <em>common purpose</em>.</li>
  <li>The thread is the web of relationships that comprise and organization, not a mechanism to exploit or control outcomes.</li>
  <li>The paradox of leadership is that the central responsibility of the leader can never be fully realized because the total situation is not static.</li>
  <li>I think what I like about this is the constant becoming aware of, coming to, letting go, sensing again cycle that it invites. A freshness that is always present, always more full and alive than we can imagine.</li>
  <li>It is not enough to see the situation, the leader must also see the <em>evolving</em> situation, the <em>developing</em> situation, a situation that is constantly changing all the time.</li>
  <li>Making is what leadership is about. The making of leadership is to create the future because, as Follett points out, we usually "have the situation that we make" which relies upon the leader's understanding of the relation between all the different factors. It is not just meeting the next situation, it is <em>making</em> the next situation.</li>
  <li>Leading and following are not antithetical. It is followers who provide leadership, who enable leaders to lead</li>
  <li>Ultimately, there is no such thing as a leader, there is only leadership</li>
  <li><em>Common purpose</em> is the invisible leader of both leaders and followers. Sometimes we may be called to share our expertise (which I think can look like the role of leader) but ultimately when we are followers of the common purpose then we have the best chance at the common bond of union.</li>
  <li>Follett wanted to bust the myth that “leaders are born, not made.”</li>
  <li>Follett talks about a “diffused leadership”, but I am not yet clear on what exactly that means.</li>
  <li>The total situation is always in the process of becoming another situation, common purpose can only be supposed through attempts to figure out the always transitory total situation, and leadership (not leaders) is the way to sense make and find the threads and overall structure.</li>
  <li>I appreciate how much she plays with paradox, especially given my recent trainings in Gestalt. Follett was influenced by Gestalt as well. Chapter 5 of her book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Experience-Mary-Parker-Follett-ebook/dp/B01IPHN9Z2/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=mary+parker+follett&amp;qid=1682197685&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=mary+follett%2Cstripbooks%2C330&amp;sr=1-3">Creative Experience</a> is titled “Experience in the Light of Recent Psychology: The Gestalt Concept.”</li>
</ul>

					<![CDATA[
						<p>This morning I finally caught up on Bill Plotkin's three part essay, <em>Who is Up for Building a Cathedral</em> (<a href="https://myemail.constantcontact.com/Who-s-Up-for-Building-a-Cathedral---Part-I--SM322--Bill-Plotkin-Soulcraft-Musing.html?soid=1102010840526&amp;aid=lUl0tzr9FGU">Part I</a>, <a href="https://myemail.constantcontact.com/Who-s-Up-for-Building-a-Cathedral---Part-II--SM323--Bill-Plotkin-Soulcraft-Musing.html?soid=1102010840526&amp;aid=v5hfjf_di2A">Part II</a>, <a href="https://myemail.constantcontact.com/Who-s-Up-for-Building-a-Cathedral---Part-III--SM324--Bill-Plotkin-Soulcraft-Musing.html?soid=1102010840526&amp;aid=FYyIMj3qdG4">Part III</a>), that contextualizes Joseph Campbell's myth of the Hero's Journey as a guide to the adolescent phase of life (defined not by age but by developmental life stage that spans from early adolescence to late adolescence). There are many gifts that this phase of life offers, including exuberance and fiery creativity. But we have prolonged adolescence until it has become pathological, facing a true scarcity of adults and elders. And in this capacity, the Hero's Adventure doesn't offer us any way out, any path beyond the egocentric path of the solo superstar.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And this brings us right to the heart of what I most want to share with you in this essay: The difficulty for any given person in accessing or recognizing a mature framework (a framework for true maturity) is not only that person’s culture but, even more so, their developmental stage. Maybe it’s just obvious: If someone has not themselves matured beyond early adolescence, then their lens, too, will necessarily be adolescent; everything they experience will be seen and understood through that lens. The caterpillar cannot truly imagine the life of a butterfly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quote above captures the essence of what Plotkin writes about, the concession that many myths beyond the Hero's Journey exist, but we cannot see them accurately from the perspective of adolescence because from that vantage point, <em>everything</em> looks like the Hero's Journey. There isn't enough maturity or sensitivity to see things otherwise. A few hours later I was listening to <a href="https://www.coachesrising.com/podcast/an-invitation-into-wholeness-with-veronica-and-alexander-love-and-lorie-dechar/">“An Invitation Into Wholeness,”</a> an episode of the Coaches Rising podcast with Veronica Olalla Love, Alexander Love, and Lorie Dechar. While I'm only halfway through, the beginning half of the conversation covered the necessity of both transactional and transformational coaching. The former being oriented around supporting a client in getting from A to B, the latter being more of a fundamental questioning of our very being and orientation to life.</p>

<p>The starting point of that particular conversational thread was a question of whether it is useful to orient around the future at all, with some people saying that any vision of the future pulls you out of the present in a detrimental way. Their consideration was nuanced and transcended the polarity with some both/and thinking, but what I thought paralleled Plotkin's piece was the idea that in a future orientation that is perspectival, then you are stuck within a perspectival futurism, in the same way once you are in the adolesence of the Hero's Journey every other myth looks like the Hero's Journey. I'm making a note of this because it's an interesting thread to come back to, and both are very Gebserian in nature. Which is also a note to self to continue my reading of Jeremy Johnson's <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/seeing-through-the-world-jean-gebser-and-integral-consciousness-jeremy-d-johnson/9691712?ean=9781947544154">Seeing Through the Wold</a>, a kind of intro text for Gebser and integral consciousness.</p>

<p>Unrelated to the themes above, there were some interesting threads relating to AI and deworlding on Substack, but given that it is a <a href="https://buttondown.email/thehypothesis/archive/heres-why-substacks-scam-worked-so-well/">platform for white supremacy</a> (or a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/14/substack-ceo-chris-best-doesnt-realize-hes-just-become-the-nazi-bar/">Nazi Bar</a>, if you will) I'm not very interested in linking to them. Not sure how to reconcile this in the long run, but fine with just keeping research notes and hoping people leave the racist platform.</p>

					<![CDATA[
						<p>Continuing to collect links and insights that are helping me make sense of the most recent season of <strong>Is Artificial Intelligence Intelligent</strong>? Of course the day after I wrote the <a href="../../the-becoming/005">ChatGPT edition of the becoming</a>, Intelligencer published <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-emily-m-bender.html">You Are Not a Parrot</a> which says a lot of what I was trying to say but much better, and with more experts.</p>

<p>Then John Maeda sent out the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/simons-scissors-weizenbaums-wisdom-nicholas-dr-john-maeda/">March 2023 #DesignInTech briefing</a>, in which he includes a passage from <a href="http://blogs.evergreen.edu/cpat/files/2013/05/Computer-Power-and-Human-Reason.pdf">Computer Power and Human Reason</a>, penned by one Dr. Joseph Weizenbaum who apparently invented the chatbot back in 1967, so definitely has some street cred:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I knew of course that people form all sorts of emotional bonds to machines, for example, to musical instruments, motorcycles, and cars. And I knew from long experience that the strong emotional ties many programmers have to their computers are often formed after only short exposures to their machines. What I had not realized is that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people.
This insight led me to attach new importance to questions of the relationship between the individual and the computer, and hence to resolve to think about them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once more for everyone in the back, <strong><em>extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people</em></strong>. I mean, this feels like what is happening, no?</p>

<p>To keep our heads spinning, <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4">GPT-4</a> was just released, along with a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774">white paper</a> I haven't read (yet) but <a href="https://twitter.com/emilymbender/status/1636089802260111360">it sure doesn't sound very open</a>.</p>

<p>My working assumption right now is that to whatever extent intelligence is being attributed to these tools, we are dealing with projection. Because if you look at the larger zeitgeist and polarizations that are happening in this country (around the world, really) and the intense desire to dehumanize a large part of the planet (I mean, the same desire that's been around for at least 500 years with the rampant violence and subjugation of humans and nature), what is with the urge to humanize a Large Language Model? And if you took the other side and assume these projections are based on positive qualities, then we run the risk of transforming these models into gods.</p>

<p>But either way you look at it, the one thing that remains true for projections is that they function to absolve us of any responsibility in the matter. And that is what scares me the most.</p>

<p>I am beginning to think these projections matter more than whether or not these models are <em>actually</em> intelligent (I need a philosophy tutor just to approach the depth of knowledge and nuance required to be able to coherently contribute to a conversation around "what is intelligence?"). I do think that these models will become part of agentic systems that will be tasked with going off and doing things like scientific research, engineering, business/military/political strategy, hacking, and social persuasion/manipulation (see <a href="https://joecarlsmith.com">Joe Carlsmith</a>'s <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13353.pdf">paper examining the risk factors of power-seeking AI</a> for more on this). Which to me reads like creating tools that further the extractive and violent model of human living (e.g. colonialism, white supremacy). If domination is what we reify, domination we will get. Who is building LLMs that will write poetry, compose sonnets, and delight in the beauty of a butterfly? Not as a cute parlor trick but in a capacity that supports the tending of the human parts of ourselves (and no, this does not look like a 'mental health app' coughed up from the hellscape of capitalist consumerism).</p>

<p>In The Trap of Gargantius, the First Sally of inventors Klapacius and Trurl is at the behest of a king in search of a way of augmenting his army to act as one, which presumably translates into conquest on the battle field. To this end, the two intrepid inventors go about outfitting each soldier with the hardware required to link one to the next. But as each individual connects and the collective mind grows, the unexpected begins to happen.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fearsome metallic clatter of closing contacts reverberated over the future battlefield; in the place of a thousand bombardiers and grenadiers, commandos, lancers, gunners, snipers, sappers and marauders—there stood two giant beings, who gazed at one another through a million eyes across a mighty plain that lay beneath billowing clouds. There was absolute silence. That famous culmination of consciousness which the great Gargantius had predicted with mathematical precision was now reached on both sides. <strong>For beyond a certain point militarism, a purely local phenomenon, becomes civil, and this is because the Cosmos Itself is by nature wholly civilian, and indeed, the minds of both armies had assumed truly cosmic proportions! Thus, though on the outside armor still gleamed, as well as the death-dealing steel of artillery, within there surged an ocean of mutual good will, tolerance, an all-embracing benevolence, and bright reason.</strong> - Lem, Stanislaw. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Cyberiad/dp/0241467993/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1679086629&amp;sr=8-1">The Cyberiad</a> (p. 42).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I'm on the lookout for mischievous robot inventors instigating random acts of kindness, humor, and goodwill.</p>

<p>Oh, and one more thing. A <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bG0yIdawiUvwh7m0AnXV5W6JHkK9xwXemuVjSU5tbhQ/preview">collection of suggested readings</a> from the #StochasticParrotsDay live stream hosted by the <a href="https://www.dair-institute.org">DAIR institute</a>.</p>

						<p>We live our lives within the rhythms and cycles of the physical world. Our calendars commemorate this by marking each full rotation of the earth as a day, the total cycle of the moon around the earth as a month, and the complete trip of the earth around the sun as a year. Though modern life and the Time Grid<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> suggest otherwise, our animal bodies are intimately tied to these rhythms through circadian cycles that let us know when to rest and when to move.</p>

<p>The end of the year, the equinox, the solistice, the end of a quarter - these can all be an auspicious and meaningful times to pause, reflect, and celebrate. To deepen what is congruent and course correct where we feel out of alignment. “At the End of the Cycle” is an exercise in service of you and your journey, and it can be completed whenever it is you feel called to mark some kind of transition, yearly<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> or otherwise.</p>

<p>This exercise has three parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Part 1: Becoming the Being That You Are.</strong> A macro level reflection about who you are and what you are becoming. Think of this as a snapshot of what holds deep meaning and resonance for you and your life, and less about the particular events of the last cycle.</li>
  <li><strong>Part 2: Reflecting on the Past Cycle.</strong> Understanding what shaped you over the course of the past cycle. This takes a more traditional reflection approach across various dimensions of life.</li>
  <li><strong>Part 3: Declaring Future Possibilities.</strong> Writing a letter to Future You, who will be starting the reflection process some time from now (whether that is in 3 months, 6 months, a year is entirely up to you). The letter acts as a synthesis of the work you did in Part 1 and Part 2, while simultaneously weaving in commitments about the future you are creating <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’d prefer that in business terms:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Part 1: The Balance Sheet of You.</strong> A snapshot of who you are in the present. You can even map this exercise to the <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/accounting/accounting-equation/">accounting equation</a>: your wholeness = who you are + how you resist.</li>
  <li><strong>Part 2: The Income Statement of Life.</strong> A summary of the past cycle across various dimensions of life.</li>
  <li><strong>Part 3: Letter to Shareholders.</strong> In this case the shareholder is Future You.</li>
</ul>

<p>A few tips: I recommend not doing this all in one sitting, but if that’s your jam then go for it. If any reflection or exercise does not feel good to you, skip it. Create whatever kind of space you need to engage in this work. This could be with a cup of tea and a cozy chair, outside in nature, at a your favorite cafe, with a group of friends, or at a noisy bar. Et cetera.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="an-interlude-the-letter">An Interlude: The Letter</h2>
<p>If you did this exercise from a previous cycle, now is the time to read the letter you wrote to your future self. If you have no idea what this means, don’t worry about it! Move on to the next section.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-becoming-the-being-that-you-are">Part 1: Becoming the Being That You Are</h2>
<p>The intention of this exercise is to facilitate a macro understanding of who you understand yourself to be, in this very moment. Of sensing into what it is you long for and what holds you back. To connect with your wholeness, areas of resistance, and the possibilities that open up when you can hold both, together.</p>

<h3 id="who-you-are">Who you are</h3>
<p>Take a few breaths and connect with yourself in this moment. What are you in connection with, what felt senses are arising, and what is your capacity to be with what is here, now? Answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who am I in this moment? Who do I understand myself to be?</li>
  <li>What am I up to in the world?</li>
  <li>What matters?</li>
  <li>What do I really believe?</li>
  <li>What do I really want?</li>
  <li>How do my thoughts, practices, moods, and habits contribute to my sense of who I am?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-you-resist">How You Resist</h3>
<p>As you worked through the previous exercise, did you notice any resistance to what you were thinking, feeling, and writing? As you begin to observe the resistance, answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What am I resisting?</li>
  <li>How do I do that?</li>
  <li>What is underneath the resistance?</li>
  <li>What limiting beliefs do I hold?</li>
  <li>How does this keep me safe?</li>
  <li>How do my thoughts, practices, moods, and habits support my resistance?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="appreciating-your-wholeness">Appreciating Your Wholeness</h3>
<p>Who you are and how you resist are all part of your wholeness, the system of you. Resistance serves a purpose, though it may not always be obvious. Take a moment to appreciate all of who you are, and all of how you resist. See if you can drop in and really appreciate every part of you. Answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who am I in my wholeness?</li>
  <li>How can I deeply appreciate my wholeness?</li>
  <li>What is possible when I fully appreciate my wholeness?</li>
  <li>With this knowledge, what new thoughts, practices, moods, and habits do I want to begin?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="part-2-reflecting-on-the-past-cycle">Part 2: Reflecting on the Past Cycle</h2>
<p>The second exercise in this series takes a more traditional reflection route, and uses the events of the last cycle to acknowledge and celebrate the accomplishments, challenges, surprises, and meaning that shaped you. Some folks like to go through their calendar, photos, journals, bank accounts, and other artifacts before jumping into the reflection questions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What went well?</li>
  <li>What needs to be celebrated?</li>
  <li>What didn’t go well?</li>
  <li>What needs to be let go of?</li>
  <li>What did I learn?</li>
  <li>What did I avoid?</li>
  <li>What did I heal?</li>
  <li>What do I want to remember?</li>
  <li>What brought me energy?</li>
  <li>What depleted me?</li>
  <li>What surprised me?</li>
  <li>What disappointed me?</li>
  <li>What do I want more of?</li>
  <li>What do I want less of?</li>
  <li>What is enough?</li>
  <li>What am I grateful for?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dimensions-of-life">Dimensions of Life</h3>
<p>When answering the questions in Part 2, it can be useful to reflect on specific dimensions of your life. You can use the questions to guide reflections in a specific dimension, or include the dimensions in your answers to each question.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Relationships</li>
  <li>Love</li>
  <li>Wealth</li>
  <li>Vocation</li>
  <li>Spirituality</li>
  <li>Health &amp; Wellness</li>
  <li>Practices &amp; Habits</li>
  <li>Adventure</li>
  <li>Community &amp; Service</li>
  <li>Learning &amp; Growth</li>
  <li>Energy &amp; Vitality</li>
  <li>Nature</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="part-3-declaring-future-possibilities-aka-the-letter">Part 3: Declaring Future Possibilities (aka The Letter)</h2>

<p>Once you feel complete with the appreciation and reflection exercises, give yourself space to let the work settle. This may look like taking a break (15 minutes, 1 day, 1 week, whatever feels right for you), creating a completion ritual, changing locations, having a mini-dance party, making some tea, really anything that can give you a sense of closing out and completing the first part of the process.</p>

<p>When you are ready to begin The Letter, take a few moments to settle your mind. Sit quietly and follow your breath, feel your feet on the floor and your seat in the chair. What do you notice? What sensations are you aware of? Allow the impressions from your reflections to float into your awareness.
Imagine you are sitting across from your future self, one year from today. Your future self that has just started the yearly reflection process. The first thing your future self will do is read the letter you are about to write.</p>

<p>What do you want Future You to know? Sitting here now, in this exact moment, what seeds of the future do you hold and what hopes do you have for what these seeds will grow into? What do you want your future self to know about who you are and what you long for? Your hopes and dreams? What you are committed to? If you are a goal-oriented person, this is a great place to talk about the goals you set and achieved.</p>

<p><em>There is absolutely no wrong way to do this.</em> However you feel called to communicate with Future You a year from now, do that. A letter, a video, a song, a collage, whatever captures what you are living into. Allow your creativity and heart to lead this process.
When you are finished with the letter, put it somewhere safe. You will read it one year from now when you sit down once again to reflect on the year and the person you are becoming.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="closing-with-gratitude">Closing With Gratitude</h2>

<p>To close out the reflection process, take a moment to express your gratitude for everything and everyone that has brought you to where you are today, and for the amazing person you are (becoming). Let the gratitude fully wash over you before you get up and continue move back into the flow of life.</p>

					<![CDATA[
						<p>The pace of change today — technological, societal, environmental, geopolitical — is increasing at such a rapid rate that it can be destabilizing to our individual identities. Those of us caught up in the expansive reach of free-market capitalism have cultivated a sense of urgency, entrepreneurialism, and problem-solving when it comes to change. We learn productivity frameworks like <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/a4wo118/smart-goals">S.M.A.R.T.</a>, <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/">OKR</a>, and <a href="https://business.adobe.com/blog/basics/bhag">BHAG</a> through which we articulate compelling visions and measure success. And while these approaches have a place, both in the business world and in our personal lives, these frameworks inherently narrow the world in service of what we must achieve at the expense of who we authentically are.</p>

<p>Developing a healthy relationship to change is essential, both personally and professionally, to stay connected to ourselves while adjusting creatively to changing conditions. As each year comes to an end many of us collectively engage in the ritual of New Year’s Resolutions. We identify what we need to start or stop doing to become the type of person that is fully deserving of safety, connection, and belonging. We decide that if we just lose a little more weight, eat healthier, meditate more, work harder, are less stressed, then everything will be ok. And yet, despite our best intentions, <a href="https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/studies-show-91-percent-of-us-wont-achieve-our-new-years-resolutions-how-to-be-9-percent-that-do.html">91% of us won’t achieve our New Year’s Resolutions</a>.</p>

<p>When it comes to the stirrings of the soul, productivity frameworks aren’t the right fit. We can become so focused on specific outcomes in the future that we close ourselves off to who we are in the present. It’s a wonder that even 9% can achieve New Year’s Resolutions!
So what are we to do? The world of Gestalt psychology offers us another option, a theory of change that is more sustainable, less effortful, and embraces the complexity of the world. The theory so simple it doesn’t even require an acronym.</p>

<p>I’m going to share it with you right now. Ready? Here it is:</p>

<p><strong>Change occurs when you become what you are, not by becoming what you are not <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-island-where-it-all-works-out">The Island Where it All Works Out</h2>

<p class="caption"><img src="/images/essays/the-island.jpg" alt="photo of an island from above in the middle of a big blue sea" />

<p>I’d like to tell you about an island you may have heard of: The Island Where It All Works Out. On this island are all the things that we lack today that, when achieved, will bring a sense of success, accomplishment, and peace. We come to a sense of these things through our environment — messages from the systems we inhabit that define what it means to be a successful and valued member of society. Things like owning a house, having an amazing job, finding a partner, being a fully competent human that never makes mistakes; these all live on the island. And if we can just get to the island, everything will work out.</p>

<p>When we catch sight of The Island it lights a fire in us. We set out to get there as quickly as possible, whatever it takes. It’s uncomfortable and unsatisfying being where we are, but on the island we know we can relax because we will have made it. Whatever winds, currents, weather patterns, and mighty whales get in our way, we push forward with force — nothing can take us off course.</p>

<p>When we finally get to the island, somewhat worse for the wear because of the grind and sacrifices we had to make, we realize that the island we have reached isn’t the exact island we set out for. It’s a little run down and lackluster, missing a few things we now realize are also important to achieve satisfaction and contentment. The Island Where It All Works out is still off in the distance. And so we set out again.</p>

<p>You are probably starting to catch on to what is happening. This island certainly is problematic, isn’t it?</p>

<p>There is something I’d like you to know, a little secret if you will. There are two choices that you have when it comes to The Island: the
first is to realize that The Island doesn’t actually exist. You will never reach it because it is not there. The other choice you have is to realize <em>you are already on The Island</em> 🤯.</p>

<p>Which one brings you the biggest sense of relief? Go with that one.</p>

<p>What does The Island have to do with change? When we realize that The Island doesn’t exist (or that we are already on the island) we stop pushing so hard into the future and turn towards the present and the reality of what we are right now. We let go of the there and allow ourselves to be here. And when we can be fully present with what is, that is when real change begins.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-paradox-of-change">The Paradox of Change</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/50836-the-curious-paradox-is-that-when-i-accept-myself-just">“The curious paradox is that when I accept myself as I am, then I can change.”</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Take a minute and imagine a change in your life you are trying to make. For example maybe you want to be more productive, lose weight, start a side hustle, connect more with people. Sense into how, in that desire for change, you deny anything about you that is getting in your way of achieving that goal. Notice how you do this, how you deny these parts of you. The part of you that procrastinates, indulges, resists, is withdrawn. How do you feel about these parts? You might notice an inner critic or judge saying very negative and mean things about them! But there is certain kind of logic to it — if these parts are getting in the way, then it makes sense to ignore them and get going on achieving the change you want to make. And yet, these disowned parts are the missing piece to making real and lasting change.</p>

<p>What is happening as you explore your hope for change is that you are already stepping into what you think you need to become. In this process a lot of energy is tied up in denying the parts of you that appear to get in the way. You might hear yourself saying things like, “If I was just a little more like this…,” or “If I wasn’t so much like that…,” as you work through this exercise. It can feel confusing and exhausting to exist in this state. To maintain the denial of certain parts of you in order to become something you are not.</p>

<p>A metaphor might help here. Imagine you are setting out on a road trip across the country. You pick a destination on the opposite coast and begin to plan your route. But you are so unhappy with where you currently live that you deny you are actually there. You spend a lot of time and energy maintaining the idea that you live somewhere else entirely! How on earth can you plan the trip if you don’t know where you are starting from?</p>

<p>This is what happens when we try to become something we are not before accepting what we are. We need a solid foundation in order to begin. And this is the core idea behind the paradoxical theory of change: <em>change happens by becoming fully who we are</em>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="okay-but-ive-got-goals">Okay, but I've got GOALS!</h2>
<p>You might be wondering how this impacts all the things you want to achieve and have and do <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. When it comes to goals, I have a proposition: what if we thought of them more as a direction, and less as a destination? If we used them as symbolic pointers to help uncover what holds deep meaning and purpose in our lives? If you are willing to do this, two possibilities emerge:</p>

<p>1) What you achieve isn’t exactly what you set out to do, but in the process of uncovering the deeper meaning of your goal you connect with the fullest expression of your own aliveness. By using the goal as a direction rather than a destination, you are able to cultivate a relationship to what is most aligned and coherent for you.</p>

<p>2) You reach your goal unexpectedly, through an indirect and winding path. In each moment you connect with who and where you are, and each next step is taken with integrity and alignment. When you eventually reach your goal, you are a different person than the one that started out, transformed by your relationship with change and in connection with the expression of your full aliveness.</p>

<p>In each of these scenarios we are cultivating a <em>relationship</em> with change. We are allowing ourselves to be responsive to change, to be open and in conversation with it as we move through life. We don’t have this relationship when we are trying to reach The Island. We construct a reality in which the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, and we brute force our way through with maximum energy and effort. This geometric arrangement between here and there may be true in Euclidean space but it does not hold up in the face of the complexity of human living. Being in relationship with change means that we are flexible to the ever changing circumstances of our environment and of ourselves, and through awareness, acceptance, and appreciation of <em>what is</em>, find creative ways of responding. This is decidedly <em>not</em> a straight line.</p>

<p>“Tropism” is a word that denotes an animal or plant’s ability to turn or move in response to a stimulus. The way some animals can orient to true north or magnetic fields, and the way plants reach towards the sun. When we invoke our ability to orient to what feels most coherent with who we are, the ways in which we navigate change become more nourishing, effortless, and energizing.</p>

<p>Take your big goal: to go to a certain university, get a promotion, work at a specific company, buy a house, etc. Really imagine it. Now, connect to not the <em>thing</em> but the <em>qualities</em> that thing represents, the ones that light you up whenever you think about them. By way of example I’ll share one of mine: ever since I was in middle school I have wanted to work at NASA.</p>

<p>To me NASA represents collaboration, dreaming big, pushing boundaries, creativity, possibility, and a coming togetherness. There is something that I can <em>feel</em> in this image of a space colony that I first saw when I was in 7th grade <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="/images/essays/space-colony.jpg" alt="illustration of a space colony in a cylindar in space" />
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/retrofuturistic-nasa-space-art">Rick Guidice’s</a> illustration of a torodial space colony, 1970.</p>

<p>As a destination I have not reached the Work At Nasa Island. But this image has consistently held a resonant directionality that has illuminated my path over the years. Who knows, maybe someday I will find myself at the doorstep of the Ames Research Center! But whether I do or not is secondary to honoring the seed of aliveness in this image and navigating life by accepting, appreciating, and being what I am.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="befriending-reality">Befriending Reality</h2>

<p>If this resonates with you, you might be wondering how you can you make reality your BFF. I’ve outlined some steps you can take to engage with this work below. Unlike productivity frameworks, this is not something you can approach intellectually. You must work with change through direct experience and then integrating what you learn into your body and attitude.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Wherever you happen to be right now take a moment pause, settle in, and take a few breaths.</li>
  <li>Now bring to mind a dilemma, a challenge, or some point of tension in your life. Describe the dilemma (either to yourself or to a trusted partner). Don’t worry about how you might resolve it, just explore the dilemma itself.</li>
  <li>As you share, notice what comes into your awareness. Notice what happens in your body as well as any feelings and thoughts that are present. Where do you notice tension, constriction, holding, frustration?</li>
  <li>Notice how you organize yourself in relationship to the challenge you face in your life. What is it like for you to be in that? In the the tension of the dilemma?</li>
  <li>Begin to explore what is good about how you are holding that tension. What is working in that tension? What can be appreciated about how that is serving you right now?</li>
  <li>For example, if you begin to notice that procrastination is playing a role in your dilemma, see if you can let go of any judgements and appreciate how procrastination is working for you . Maybe procrastination creates space for you to focus on multiple things at once. Maybe it keeps you safe by holding you back from completing a project and putting yourself in the position of potentially hearing negative feedback. That’s a pretty important role that procrastination is playing! See if you can really appreciate that.</li>
  <li>Continue to cultivate a sense of appreciation for what you are in this moment. Every single part of you has an intelligence that is working for you in some way, shape, or form. You wouldn’t be doing what you are doing if it wasn’t intended to support you in some way.</li>
  <li>Watch what happens when you do this, when you really sit with and accept and appreciate all of you. Allow the appreciation to melt the structures of judgement that have held you in place for so long. You might also notice that more energy begins to become available. This energy might want to be mobilized in a certain way. If it does, roll with it!</li>
  <li>Keep noticing what is. Herb Stevenson writes that if you can fully stay with your experience, change is inevitable. As much as possible allow your resistance to soften and be with reality as it is in the moment.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ultimately what you are doing in this process is increasing your capacity for awareness, acceptance, and appreciation which allows you to settle into to exactly what you are, without leaving anything out. Your starting place is always in accepting what is. In what is present in doing, thinking, feeling, wanting. And as you build this capacity you will begin to understand how you do what you do, both the benefits and the cost. And what you will find, as you engage in this process, is that you have access to a wider range of possibilities in how you respond and react to life.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="give-it-a-whirl">Give it a Whirl</h2>

<p>When we fight with reality and try to become what we are not, energy becomes trapped in the structures that hold us in patterns of denial. By fully accepting and appreciating who we are right now, even the parts of us that we have opinions about, we can release the trapped energy of stuckness and use it to be more choiceful in how we move in the world. The more we do this, the more be build the flexibility to respond to changing conditions with creativity while also staying connected to ourselves. We find our ground in the foundation of what is, and from this place we can take the next best move in response to change.</p>
