    <h2>❏ Notes to Self 002 - The Question Concerning Technology in China, pp 8 - 18</h2>
        <p>There are four books I am working with right now to find an expression of an intuition that I have around technology, design, and worlding. These books are <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/tree-of-knowledge-the-biological-roots-of-human-understanding-francisco-j-varela/11685553?ean=9780877736424">The Tree of Knowledge</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Transforming-Technology-Critical-Theory-Revisited/dp/0195146158/ref=sr_1_3?crid=XFE8AB8P5ZXT&amp;keywords=transforming+technology&amp;qid=1679511466&amp;sprefix=transforming+technolo%2Caps%2C212&amp;sr=8-3">Transforming Technology</a>, <a href="(https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-question-concerning-technology-in-china-an-essay-in-cosmotechnics-yuk-hui/9845183?ean=9780995455009)">The Question Concerning Technology in China</a>, and <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/are-we-human-notes-on-an-archaeology-of-design-beatriz-colomina/636352?ean=9783037785119">are we human?</a>. The sense making is slow going, but it is going.</p>

The four books in question.</p>

<p>Last night <a href="https://indieweb.social/@pnts/110064602790030098">when the power went out</a>, I spent some time doing a closer reading of pages 8 - 18 in Hui's book, "The Question Concerning Technology in China: An Essay on Cosmotechnics." Below are my notes.</p>

<hr />

<p>Hui seems to concede that technics is generally understood as an extension of the body or the externalization of memory. Body <em>and</em> memory. Somatics <em>and</em> cognition.)</p>

<p>He states the beginning of technics is with the Australanthropos.</p>

<p>So what is distinguishing isn’t that, per se, but the way in which technics are perceived/reflected on in different cultures. And this, if I am understanding it correctly, is why an understanding of the mythological origins of technics is important, and why he goes into a reading of Prometheus and the Chinese Kingdoms.</p>

<p>Now, if I am to understand this next point correctly, Hui locates the particular philosophical tradition of technics and states that technics cannot be universal. I do not claim to understand everything he is saying, but I will call out that technics, as rendered through philosophy in the way Hui talks about, becomes an ontological category and in becoming an ontological category becomes linked to the larger question of the cosmological origins from which technics emerges.</p>

<p>Birth of philosophy in Greece was a process of rationalization (note - this echoes the cognitive deworlding that I was sketching about in December).</p>

<p>Rationalization was the separation of myth and philosophy, but Hui also points out that myth is the source of and an important part of philosophy!</p>

<p>I am going to pull a quote here because I think this is meaningful even though I still am not fulling groking it, but I want to keep marinating on this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Mythology is the source and the essential component of European philosophy, <strong>which distanced itself from mythology by naturalizing the divine and integrating it as a supplement to rationality.</strong>” (emphasis mine). p. 10</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean, I think there is so much in just the second part of the sentence. What a move! Distancing through claiming (is this a form of cognitive colonization?)</p>

<p>Mythos vs logos (ah, in a passage mythos gets associated with the poets, which, if facilitating a more poetic attunement is in front of is, this feels like a piece of the puzzle).</p>

<p><strong>If philosophy consumes everything, what lies outside of it?</strong>
A passage on the top of page 11 prompted me to ask this question (another tangent, is this how we get prompted by tools and media we create, just as we prompt LLMs?). But, again, I think this goes back to the universalizing and the desire to eat/own the world. Why can’t we be okay with what lies outside the boundaries of something? Why must it all be consumed/claimed/owned (design, I am looking at you!)?</p>

<p>Okay, so this thing between mythology and philosophy, as Hui continues, I am now reading as a polarity in the Gestalt sense. Philosophy in some ways defines itself by separating itself from mythology.</p>

<p>Here is another passage that I am going to quote directly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Every demythologisation is accompanied by a remythologisation, since philosophy is conditioned by an origin from which it can never fully detached itself.” p. 11</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am quoting this directly because I wonder about this and Maturana’s conception of how we are conditioned by our origins which we can never fully know/will never fully be revealed. So I am leaving myself a to-do to go back through Tree of Knowledge and pull that into this sensemaking document.</p>

<p>What is at stake in the question of technology?</p>

<p>To understand what is at stake we have to turn to the myths of the origin of technology that have been handed down to us.</p>

<p>Hui also calls out that as long as we keep understanding technics as something that is universal, we are going to get in our own way. There is no way through with this mindset.</p>

<p>I am going to pull in one of my favorite quotes though because it’s so delicious and totally spot on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Without an understanding of this question, we will all remain at a loss, overwhelmed by the homogeneous becoming of modern technology.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On page 12 there is an important paragraph that points to the creation of a more subtle form of capitalism, but I am not sure I fully understand it. It seems to want to separate a social critique of capitalism from a negative critique of technology, in which technology can be reclaimed as a liberatory force. And Hui says this is associated with what he called ‘accelerationism’. The larger point is that Hui says that if this approach is applied globally (<em>as if Prometheus were a universal cultural figure</em>), then this is what leads to a more subtle form of colonialism (sneaaaky!).</p>

<p>Now we start to get into Prometheus (the who and the what). Here is what we know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>also called Titan Prometheus</li>
  <li>creator of human beings</li>
  <li>tasked by Zeus with distributing skills to all living beings</li>
  <li>has a brother, Epimetheus</li>
  <li>Prometheus let his brother do his work, and in typical brother fashion Epimetheus fucked it up and didn’t give any skills to humans</li>
  <li>Prometheus didn’t want to get caught outsourcing his obligations so stole fire from Hephaestus to give to man</li>
  <li>Some say this whole thing was started not by the outsourcing, but by Prometheus directly challenging the omnipotence of Zeus by “playing a trick with a sacrificial offering” (source: Theogony - not tracking that down now)</li>
  <li>And Zeus got so mad he “hid fire and the <em>means of living</em> from human beings” (well, this is interesting phrasing)</li>
  <li>And so when Zeus hid fire, Prometheus stole fire, which, I guess means at least all accounts agree that Prometheus stole fire and this is the inciting or critical action of the whole ordeal</li>
  <li>And then Prometheus was punished by Zeus (why not, angry gods and all)</li>
  <li>Interestingly, Hui links another account (<em>Works and Days</em>) that then extends this punishment (which was originally was having his liver eaten by birds every day and then restored every night) by “visiting evil upon human beings.”</li>
  <li>This evil is Pandora</li>
  <li>Pandora, the she of fertility and of the goddess of the earth (I mean, really he is connecting the dots here and showing us how, in this mythology, domination and control become justified by the “evil” delivered by the gods. Very Edenic, after all.</li>
  <li>Hui also notes that Pandora stands for idleness and dissipation because… OMG get this (quoting directly from the book again): <em>“she stands for idleness and dissipation, since she is a <strong>gaster</strong>, an insatiable belly devouring the <strong>bios</strong> or nourishment that men procure for themselves through their labor.”</em> I mean, I wanna throw tables after reading this.</li>
  <li>EVENTUALLY, thanks to Aeschylus, Prometheus becomes the  <strong>papi of technics and the master of crafts</strong>, rather than just the delinquent that stole fire</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, so I read and noted all of that but how is Prometheus the inventor of technics? What is the critical link I missed? The stealing and bestowing of fire?</p>

<p>I guess Hui realizes that link hasn’t been fully made the accounts of what happened, and explicates a bit more the whole Aeschylus thing (maybe he should have lead with that??). Aeschylus penned <em>Prometheus Bound</em> in which Prometheus actually says that he is the originator of all the <em>technai</em> that humans have.</p>

<p>The <em>technai</em>, it seems, are numerous, and here Hui pulls a direct quote of what Prometheus says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What more, for them I invented Number (arithmon), wisdom above all others. And the painstaking putting together of Letters: to be their memory of everything, to be their Muses’ mother, their handmaid.” p. 14</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WELL THEN.</p>

<p>And if you universalize this view, then you think all cultures form techne in this very dysfunctional, domineering, extractive, trickster way.</p>

<p>BUT!</p>

<p>In China, there is another mythology concerning the origins of human beings and the origins of technics. And there is no Prometheus.</p>

<p>So, what do we know?</p>

<ul>
  <li>there were three ancient emperors</li>
  <li>each lead an ancient tribe: Fuxi, Nuwa, Shennong</li>
  <li>Nuwa is a female goddess, represented as half-human half-snake, created human beings from clay (this is not a universal origin - other accounts say humans were created by a collective work with other gods and Nuwa synthesized the collective works to carry out seventy transformations that lead to the creation of humans.</li>
  <li>Nuwa’s brother (and later husband) is Fuxi - half-dragon half-human, who invented “the eight triagrams based on a binary structure” p. 15</li>
  <li>Shennong is kinda ambiguous and has other names = Yan Di and Lie Shan Shi</li>
  <li>Shennong literally means “divine farmer” and is <em>also the god of fire</em>, becomes the god of the kitchen after his death (e.g. use of fire in the household)</li>
  <li>Shennong invented agriculture, medicine, and other technics</li>
  <li>This is a very complex system with various mythologies, but what Hui wants to note is that the gods of agriculture and fire come from different systems of mythology and are only recognized as gods after their deaths (see the first bullet in that they were leaders of ancient tribes)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, the important distinction here is that Prometheus’ act was rebellious against the gods and through his act he bestowed on humans fire and the means of subsistence which <em>”raised them above animals”</em> (emphasis mine, p. 16), no transcendence happened in Chinese mythology. The abilities come from the benevolence of the sages.</p>

<p>And apparently this separation of the world of the gods and the world of man was critical to the development of Greek rationality (how? does Hui get into this? Are we just supposed to know?), which of course didn’t happen in China. China instead ‘naturalized the divine’.</p>

<p>And through this, Greeks also developed polarizations - man/gods, invisible/visible, eternal/mortal, permanent/changing, powerful/powerless, pure/mixed, certain/uncertain - none of these developed in China (which, Hui says, “might partially explain why it was the Greeks who invented tragedy” omg I am dying lol philosophy humor.).</p>

<p>What we want to look at here isn’t simply different origins, but what this draws out in the relationship between gods, technics, humans, and the cosmos.</p>

<p>Okay, so this I think lands Hui in explicating one of his core propositions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I propose that it is only by tracing different accounts of the genesis of technicity that we can understand what we mean when we speak of different ‘forms of life’, and thus different relations to technics.” p.12</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: ‘technicity’ comes from Gilbert Simondon who has ideas that technological development <em>“should be understood as a lineage of constant bifurcation that begins during the magical phase of human societies”</em> (note to self:  this feels very GEBSERIAN).</p>

<p>SO. Phew. This is a lot. But let us continue…</p>

<p>What Western approaches have traditionally done in their conception of technology is to <em>“articulate technology through the comparison of the advancement of technological objects or technological systems in different periods among different cultures.” p. 17</em></p>

<p>I guess the way I would say that is if we do not take into account the impact of understanding the cosmological origins of technics then we risk reducing how we understand and interpret technology across cultures into objects and systems (which yes, tracks).</p>

<p>Going in for another direct quote because in this passage Hui really articulates the origin of ‘cosmotechnics’.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Scientific and technical thinking emerges under cosmological conditions that are expressed in the relations between humans and their milieus, which are never static. For this reason I would like to call this conception of technics <em>cosmotechnics</em>.” p. 18</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to capture the final prompt in this section, one that illustrates an example of Chinese cosmotechnics, <em>“One of the most characteristic examples of Chinese cosmotechnics, for example, is Chinese medicine, which uses the same principles and terms found in cosmology, such as _Yin-Yang, Wu Xing, harmony, and so on, to describe the body.” p. 18</em></p>
