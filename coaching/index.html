    <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>My approach to coaching is broad, deep, and completely customized.</p>

    <p>People usually come to coaching when there is some kind of breakdown or stuck-ness showing up in their life that isn't getting resolved. With executive coaching this can look like needing to level-up your leadership game, build resilience, develop executive presence, have difficult conversations, quite the inner-critic, manage teams, and lead through change (to name a few). Sometimes it can also mean a transition into a new role, organization, or career.</p>

    <p>Whatever you come to coaching with, the goal, outcome, or possibility you long for becomes the foundation of our coaching container. From there, everything is designed for you and your way of being in the world. Some people prefer more structure and a formal coaching program. Others prefer less structure and choose to work with whatever presents itself moment to moment. A bi-weekly meeting cadence combined with email and text support builds the container in purposeful way to facilitate your development both personally and professionally.</p>

    <p>I bring a wide range of training, education, and experience to coaching. <a href="https://newventureswest.com">Integral Coaching</a>, <a href="https://integralunfoldment.com">Integral Unfoldment</a>, and <a href="https://strozziinstitute.com">Somatic Leadership</a> are the foundation of my coaching approach. I weave in organizational design, business management, and strengths-based approaches to transformation from my <a href="https://weatherhead.case.edu">MBA</a>, embodied meditation approaches from the <a href="https://realizationprocess.org">Realization Process</a>, breathing and yoga practices informed by <a href="https://www.parayoga.com">Parayoga</a>, ongoing work in <a href="https://www.ticiess.com/racial-healing-allies">racial healing</a> and <a href="https://www.mitelnexwleadershipsociety.org/individuals">decolonizing practices</a>, as well as extensive experience building and running product and design teams at the executive level.</p>

    <p>Typical engagements run 6 - 12 months. For this type of work, a minimum of 6 months is recommended.</p>

    <h2>Team Coaching</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>Whether your team is stuck or just wanting to flow better together, team coaching works with team identities, practices, and cultures to shift ways of working that lead to deeper impact and stronger outcomes.  </p>

    <p>Built on the principles and foundations of individual coaching, team coaching integrates a holistic, systems-based approach to helping teams work better together.</p>

    <p>It all begins with an opening. Something isn't working, the team is facing a new challenge, the team has grown and needs a reset, whatever it is something feels off, or amiss. Through in-depth interviews with team members and stakeholders, we'll start to get a sense of what the underlying issues, challenges, and stuck-ness might be.
    </p>

    <p>The coaching program, ranging from unstructured to highly structured depending on the needs of the team, is completely customized to help the team step into new ways of working together, including communication, commitments, identity, culture, purpose, and power, both within the team, and in the ways the team interacts with other parts of the organization.</p>

  <div class="col-2">
    <p>Group coaching combines the power of action learning and integral development coaching to support leaders in creatively tackling the challenges they face while practicing the skills they need on the job. Group coaching provides a safe and open space for managers to explore challenges, develop critical skills through practice, and build deeper cross-cultural connections.</p>

    <h2>Principles</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <h3 class="principles">1. Transformation takes place at biological time</h3>
    <p>Nature teaches us that there is a cadence for change, a progression and unfoldment that happens as we make the transition from one way of being to another. This is true for individuals, for teams, and for organizations.</p>

    <h3>2. Lead with humble inquiry</h3>
    <p>The simple act of asking questions releases us from the pressure of needing to have all the answers. The work of coaching, of reflection, and of designing is built upon the questions that we ask.</p>

    <h3>3. Strengths are the doorways to possibility</h3>
    <p>Our culture tends to focus on weaknesses and tries to fix them. When we shift to strengths we open the door to possibilities and make an orthogonal leap to an entirely different problem space filled with potential.</p>

    <h3>4. Serious play moves mountains</h3>
    <p>When we play games we adopt what <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grasshopper-Games-Life-Utopia/dp/155111772X/">Bernard Suits</a> calls the lusory attitude - we accept the arbitrary rules of a game to facilitate the experience of play. Work life is nothing if not a series of arbitrary rules; the lusory attitiude allows us to step outside the system and create space for creativity and innovation.  </p>

    <h3>5. Unique leadership breaks archetypes </h3>
    <p>In the tech world we're surrounded by a very specific archetype of what leadership looks like. But there are other ways to lead, ways that are authentic to who we are as individuals and when we embody that truth we become the leaders we are meant to be.</p>

    <h3>6. Use work to do <em>the work</em> </h3>
    <p>Poet <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Heart-Aroused-Preservation-Corporate-America-ebook/dp/B000XUBFF6/">David Whyte</a> talks about <em>the chasm</em> - the split between what is nourishing at work and what is agonizing. When we learn to accept the chasm we connect more deeply with ourselves and through this connection transform our experience of work.</p>
