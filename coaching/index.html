    <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">

    <h3>People usually come to coaching seeking support to achieve audacious goals or when some kind of stuckness is showing up that isn't getting resolved. More often than not the two are interrelated.</h3>

    <p>With executive coaching this can look like: creating radical clarity and focus, leveling up your leadership game, connecting to your power, developing executive presence, having difficult conversations, working with the inner-critic, imposter syndrome, building high performing teams, and leading through change - just to name a few! Sometimes it can also mean a transition into a new role, organization, or career.</p>

    <p>We start with where you are and look at where you long to be. I see us as partners and co-creators in this work, but you are always in the driver's seat. My role is to fully <em>see</em> you and reflect what has become invisible through repeated familiarity. The deep grooves of secret strengths and limiting beliefs that over time have become your default way of being. By looking at how you interpret the world and organize yourself in response, we will uncover the narrative of who you are today and who you are becoming. This becoming is in service to your values, your fullest expression, your innate wholeness, and the goals for the coaching engagement.</p>

    <p>With some clients I also do 360s and observe them in meetings in order to ground the work in observable assessments. I often recommend this because feedback from peers can be an eye-opening catalyst for where to start and what to prioritize.</p>

    <p>Tactically we will meet every week or every-other week for 60 minutes. The challenges and opportunities you face at work can be used to build a clear awareness of self, and the systems in which the self operates. This awarness is the foundation of choiceful and courageous leadership. By connecting to your innate resourcefulness and creativity through the three centers of intelligence - mind, heart, and body - you will discover new ways to sense and respond in this rapidly changing world.

    <p>Based on what we learn in each session, we will co-design small experiments for you to run in the working world. Experiments act as a feedback loop that can accelerate learning and transformation, practiced in a safe and supportive way. I'm available between sessions via text and email, and 30 minute spot coaching sessions can be scheduled as needed. </p>

    <h2>Team Coaching</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <h3>Whether your team is stuck or just wanting to flow better together, team coaching works with team identities, practices, and cultures to shift ways of working that lead to deeper impact and stronger outcomes.  </h3>

    <p>Built on the principles and foundations of individual coaching, team coaching integrates a holistic, systems-based approach to helping teams work better together.</p>

    <p>It all begins with an opening. Something isn't working, the team is facing a new challenge, the team has grown and needs a reset, whatever it is something feels off, or amiss. Through in-depth interviews with team members and stakeholders, we'll start to get a sense of what the underlying issues, challenges, and stuck-ness might be.
    </p>

    <p>The coaching program, ranging from unstructured to highly structured depending on the needs of the team, is completely customized to help the team step into new ways of working together, including communication, commitments, identity, culture, purpose, and power, both within the team, and in the ways the team interacts with other parts of the organization.</p>

    <h2>Group Coaching</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">
    <h3>Group coaching combines the power of action learning and integral coaching to support leaders in creatively tackling the challenges they face while practicing the skills they need on the job.</h3>

    <p>Group coaching provides a safe and open space for leaders to explore challenges, develop critical skills through practice, and build deeper cross-cultural connections. I offer group coaching inside organizations that want to support cross-functional, cross-cultural experiential learning. Group coaching is a powerful complement to workshops and trainings, where tools and techniques can be put into practice week after week. For these engagements I typically work with HR leadership and L&D teams to ensure full alignment with internal best-practices and areas of development.</p>

    <h2>Testimonials</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="col-2">

    <p class="quote">"I highly recommend working with Andi: the experience is scary, rewarding, and transformative. It’s a journey through all the feels, and as a result of committing to that journey I lead with more confidence and strength. My purpose in working with Andi was initially focused on leveling up in my career, but the benefits of working with her transcend my career path and aspirations. My coaching container includes self-reflection, and thoughtfully curated frameworks and exercises that support the needs and challenges in my life — no small feat as we worked together in year 2 of an ongoing Pandemic. While Andi draws from her many areas of expertise, she encouraged feedback to ensure my container continued to support my needs. My team has felt the results of my investment, as have my peers, boss, and family."</p>
    <p class="source">- Head of User Experience</p>

    <div class="separator"></div>

    <p class="quote">"Andrea helped me navigate major life changes that affected my career in a big way. I grew tremendously as a person, and became far more self-aware, with her trustworthy, empathetic, and effective guidance. She helped me examine and understand my drivers  and impulses more clearly — both the ones that helped make me successful and the ones that were arguably holding me back. I walked away from every session having learned something and ready to try new approaches."</p>

    <p class="source">- Chief Product Officer</p>

    <div class="separator"></div>

    <p class="quote">"Leadership seemed to me like a foggy room on the other side of a locked door; I didn't feel qualified or invited to be in that room, and I resented the whole situation. After years of bumping my head against that door, I sought out a coach; I chose Andi because I liked her structured approach, her warmth, and her openness. I knew that working with her would require me to "go there," to be open to looking at old hurts and habits and beliefs, and I was right. But Andi made it inviting. It was scary and fun to consider all the new possibilities and capabilities I could move into. <br/><br/>

    Through our work together, I've learned to trust myself more, to see my strengths, and to embrace my "unruly" parts and enlist them in the cause of bringing my own unique leadership into the foggy room, to join the others in finding our way. I'm happier, more adventurous, more compassionate, and more effective than I have ever been as a leader or as a person. Best career development investment ever!"</p>

    <p class="source">- User Research Leader</p>

    <div class="separator"></div>

    <p class="quote">"I sought out Andrea for leadership coaching when I moved into my first executive role. In our work together she helped me to better understand my strengths and weaknesses, grow skills that were critical to my success such as relationship building, time management, and dealing with frustration, and to navigate a variety of workplace challenges that I faced. Her calming disposition and exceptional listening skills always made me feel comfortable and I appreciated how skillfully she was able to ask the exact right questions and then guide me to new insights and perspectives. I'd highly recommend Andrea to anyone who's interested in growing as both a leader and a person."</p>

    <p class="source">- Vice President of Design</p>

    <div class="separator"></div>

    <p class="quote">"Working with Andi helped me evaluate how I approached both my personal and professional lives, and understand what was getting me stuck. She is wise, compassionate and without judgment, but firm in providing the push I needed to make the right changes. I now approach things with much more intentionality and I continue to apply  the tools Andi provided me with. I cannot find the words to express what a transformative experience this journey has been for me."</p>
    <p class="source">- Director of Product Design</p>

    <div class="separator"></div>

    <p class="quote">"I had the opportunity to work with Andi over the course of a year that brought a number of significant personal and professional challenges into my life. I consider myself truly fortunate to have had the benefit of Andi's support and guidance during this time. Andi is a truly gifted coach and amazing human being. Her coaching practice brings insights from the many domains she has expertise in, from design and business leadership to holistic psychology to the martial arts. Working with her has enabled me to integrate my mind and body in ways I couldn't have imagined, to face deep-seated fears and contradictions, and to emerge from my struggles as a stronger, kinder, wiser, and more resilient person. I highly recommend working with Andi to anyone who wants to move to the next level in their personal and professional life and is ready to take a leap forward in their journey of self-realization."</p>
    <p class="source">- Senior Manager of Product Design </p>

    <div class="separator"></div>

    <p class="quote">"In my eight months with Andi, she helped me to identify my professional and personal aspirations, to develop practices that vastly improved my mental and emotional health, and to ultimately reconnect with the joy of my being. Her coaching plan was completely tailored to me, and it was always evolving with my own growth. Andi is compassionate, observant, and infinitely wise. I feel so fortunate that I was able to work with her."</p>
    <p class="source">- Creative Leader</p>

    <div class="separator"></div>

    <p class="quote">"I used to believe that it was impossible to work with people who all respected, cared for, supported, and empathized with one another. That to see one another as people, not just coworkers, was impossible. You’ve proven me so wrong. You have built an exceptional thing - a thing that I used to believe couldn’t exist... you have built a culture of kindness, strength, and vulnerability, that encourages us to sit in our discomfort, to cry, to feel mad, but then to take action, to be confident in ourselves and our principles. You’ve also shown us how to celebrate, have fun, be silly, and not take ourselves too seriously! And at the end of the day, how to share both our value and our joy."</p>
    <p class="source">- Research Manager</p>

    <div class="separator"></div>

    <p class="quote">"This team you've cultivated has invited me to live among concepts that other environments suggest are at odds with each other: to center both my vulnerability and my strengths, practice both deeper introspection and deeper empathy, feel both safe and challenged, become both more present and less afraid to step back, and embrace both the joy of play and the serious work of personal growth. I am a richer person for this every day, and I sure am happy to imagine the many more people you will make feel this way."</p>
